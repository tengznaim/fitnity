"reviews"
"FIFA sized court is really good. Well maintained and walled in so the ball can't fly out very far out of bounds. Only issue overall is the fans aren't great just like most futsal places. It's as if the owners didn't think that the players don't need ventilation.. üòÖ Other than that, pretty good! Will be back."
"One of the best in PJ area for futsal. Spacious inside, good ventilation and ample parking."
"It was a nice footsal court. But need to pay for parking"
"It's a good place for sport event expecialy futsal n batminton, cooln quiet"
"Love the new management of this futsal court, very efficient and helpful. My friends and I always have an amazing time playing at these courts. Clean and well maintained. Looking forward to be back at the court after CMCO!
can't wait."
"Friendly staff.  This place is convenient in terms of location. But poor management of the facilities have seen more roof leaks in recent times. The lights should be brighter during play as some times 1 row of lights not switched on. Prices should not increase until all of the above are fixed. They should reward faithful patrons this way"
"A place for sport. CARiNG Pharmacy is having video shooting here ‚ù§"
"Very nice futsal courts. We had a nice time. Book your court in advance. You can get slot by hours. Place is always full. The next team was ready to occupy the court when we were done at 10PM"
"I usually come here on Sunday. Good rubber badminton court. Not too stuffy, as there have huge ventilation fan on top of the building. Brightly lit. Very little echo."
"Place to play Futsal indoor soccer games"
"Needs to improve toilet condition (female). One of the courts is uneven. Everything else seems fine.

The drinks are expensive but what do you expect from futsal courts."
"It's ok. I would say that the ventilation is poor...after awhile of running around, you will feel that there's lack of air around...ladies toilet is not that properly taken care of...looks scary other that, it's ok."
"Lots of court here are well-maintained. Also, there is one FIFA court which is nice. Downside is need to pay for parking lot."
"You have to pay rm2 for parking and....the parking quiet limited. Better come car-pooling or by motorbike. Court arent that good too"
"Honestly I feel that the place will need up keeping late next year but for now everything is still ok, but you can see wear on the flooring and some of the seats are broken. You could argue that you have see worse but that does not mean that this place can't be better"
"Good place to have futsal with friends. The only FIFA court available within radius. It has surau and parking could be a hassle during peak hours as badminton courts are next door. Parking fee is expensive, RM2 per 2 hours."
"Very decent futsal centre with 3 small and 1 fifa size court. Ample of parking spaces and high ceiling so ventilation is good even on hotter days."
"I heard there's a chiro at KD branch! Can I have his number?  I love their NEW management at KD! Great job guys!"
"The actual place is tucked behind sunsuria avenue so if you missed the entrance to the compound, its a bit troublesome to get back to the same road.The normal size Futsal court floor wasn't the most comfortable to play on but it beats tarmac i guess. Toilet was poor but has surau facility which is a plus."
"The court here is superb. No doubt. Parking need to pay rm2 after 6pm. Toilet, dont go in there. Surau, is so wet and dirty and smelly."
"Their courts are decent but could use some improvements in terms of maintenance:

1) Not all fans around the futsal courts work. Even if they do, they won't last long.
2) Some goal posts are broken, and all that's keeping them together are some ropes.
3) No first aid kit for the usual/typical injuries. Not even bandage/plaster.
4) Overpriced drinks/ice cream. Bring your own if you can!

P.S. They seem to always blast slow BM rock music. I'm not sure how you're supposed to be hyped up and ready to play sports with that kind of music."
"You have to pay rm2 for parking and....the parking quiet limited. Better come car-pooling or by motorbike. Court arent that good too"

"(Translated by Google) If I'm playing with my parents, I want to order,
Don't dribble, people want to feel like holding the ball
Don't pass tru, people don't want to chase
Don't always sit down, you'll have to be a keeper later
Don't grab the ball from people, people must score
Whatever you do, don't stop people from wanting to score

(Original)
Ni kalau main dengan orang tua, aku nak pesan,
Jangan dribble, diorang nak rasa pegang bola
Jangan pass tru, diorang tak larat mengejar
Jangan selalu duduk bawah, nanti kena jadi keeper
Jangan rebut bola diorang, diorang mesti kena skor
Apa pun korang buat, jangan halang  diorang nak goal"
