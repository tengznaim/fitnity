"I have been a member on and off for a year now. Generally a clean gym and always thought instructor were good when they train others but I never took a session.

Recently, I droped my earphone cover and it landed right inside a elliptical. I tried for an hour and couldn't reach it. I was quite upset, I nervously went to a instructor called DARRYL and explained my situation. I expected him to look at a machine and just say sorry that he cat help.

To my surprise, he asked for some time and knowledgeably started to open the bottom side of eliptical to rescue my earphone case. It was so impressive as he gave me time and effort and eventually he got my earphone case back. He was so willing to help, it is amazing how nice this instructor is.

Because of DARRYL, I will not just continue but get my friends to the gym as they are also so surprised by such friendly staff.

THANK YOU DARRYL, you make Fitness First in Paradigm mall awesome!!"
"By far é Best! FF outlet in Klang Valley, love the big space & machines available-sufficient and in good condition,
Changing room & showers are spacious n clean as well-super love é shower pressure super strong it is👍🏻

Not too crowded compared to other FF outlets, i believe best time to go around 10am-3pm
but one thing if you are into classes like Combat Pump etc. here quite limited classes available

*Parking at Paradigm also one of the most reasonable rates 2-3hrs that cost me RM2

Special shout out to Kak Ida frontdesk for almost being so Welcoming!"
"Probably one of the best.
Professional frontliner, superbly clean gym. Far better than Leisure Mall Cheras Fitness First, which is the worst in Malaysia"
"I know they can’t expand the size of them gym, but that would be my only comment, this outlet is one of the smaller Fitness Firsts out there. Other than that, the equipment and sufficient and the staff are great. It’s my gym of choice."
"Was calling the outlet to ask about my membership progress and this staff by the name of Azlan is unbeliebly rude."
"One of the few well maintained ff outlet. Less crowded as well. Park at B1 near Tesco and hop on to the lift straight to level G."
"Probably the worst fitness first outlet in Malaysia 😔 not well maintained & the trainers aren't good. More of a money making business. Once registered don't care abt services and facilities. Hope they will improve like the curve, bangsar or gardens"
"Came here on the international pass from Australia. Was left in a rush, I only have the soft copy and an email from FF Melbourne to prove I’m a member.
Went to a few FF in KL for weeks and had no problems at all until recently I approached one of the consultants to ask about the rate because I might come back to Malaysia for good.
Immediately after a few days, I was stopped by a so-called manager because I don’t have the hard copy. Just because it’s end of the month and you guys have a target to achieve, doesn’t mean you can use this dirty sales tactic to push for a sale.
Would never come back anymore. Fitness First should probably rename to Finance First."
"Cancel my membership some ten years ago. The managers from the UK are very arrogant. Equipment broke down for weeks. No lockers for paying members because all taken up by those trial membership holders."
"Everything is good, from club layout to equipments. Definitely better than the so called Platinum Club - Mont Kiara and The Gardens. BUT the only thing really bad is the WiFi coverage in this club. I would suggest FF don't provide free WiFi. If really want to provide WiFi service, make sure it has full coverage in entire club. Or at least the workout area. The WiFi coverage issue has been there since day one yet nothing has been done for so many years. Poor management."
"What's not to like. Fully equipped gym under a reliable international brand. Just wish there are aerial flow yoga classes and other unique classes available"
"Facility wise it's a great gym but need to improve when they call in replacement for scheduled classes. No reason for replacement to attend class 30 minutes late! & rush through the class with no break in between 😬"
"One of the newer Fitness First outlet hence the facilities (e.g. shower facilities) and equipment are still new.  This is not a Platinum outlet hence range and number of exercise equipments are less than the Platinum outlets. They have 30+ cardiovascular machines. Free weights area is smaller than the The Curve and Empire Subang outlet.

The gym is located within the Paradigm mall - very convenient for parking and for after exercise shopping."
"Great machines, clean and spacious, doesn't have a deadlift platform though. Clean and comfortable lounge area. PTs are full of energy and nice"
"I have been using this gym for well over a year. The gym is always very clean and the staff are incredibly friendly."
"There are few confirmed Covid cases and the information were not shared promptly and transparently with all the related parties. Feel disappointed and worried as we need to persistently ask and follow up on it."
"Always my go to exercise outlet after work. Well maintained, good staff and not crowded as other branches. Blood and sweat makes a strong body."
"clean and less crowds compared to other FF, but some machines and dumbells are broken"
"Large spacious gym. Often empty which is great news. Has a steam room but no sauna. Plenty of dumbbells and benches."
"I like this place because the trainers, staff and members are friendly. It makes going to the gym more motivating"
"Nice gym with friendly n competent instructors"
"I am training here. My home membership. Nice gym.nice mall. My home is nearby.come, be a member here."

"A good place to workout but it’s too crowded especially in the evenings"

"Spacious gym with ample space and machines, treadmills, and classes. One of the newer Fitness First's"
