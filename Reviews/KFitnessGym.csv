reviews
"Cool gym with good vibe. However there's alot to improve especially in cleaning. Sanitising cloths often smell terrible even in the morning, causing the smell to stay with the equipments. Used masks are noticeable at different places too. The gym should clean the place at closing EVERYDAY and consider hiring fulltime cleaners that go around making sure the place is comfortable for us."
"1. Cheap/tacky gym with no aircond. With Malaysian heat, the inside of the gym is unbearable.
2. The staff is very rude and didn't explain which area is off-limit when you pay-per-entry.
3. Other 5 star reviews are mostly kiss-a$$ paid reviews"
"The gym itself is nice, but paying RM15 for a walk-in is definitely not worth it (the past was RM10 before 6pm++ if I was not mistaken, I entered the gym at 4pm). There is a turf zone that requires people to remove their shoes before entering this zone, first timer to this gym needs to be aware of that (There is a very small sign for you to realize). Instead of asking politely to have us remove our shoes (There is other group of people is also wearing shoes at the turf zone, so we assume its fine to have our shoes on), one of the trainer (I suppose his name starts from J) will just stare at you with a rude face several seconds, and use his finger to point the small sign and said ""look at the sign"". Come on brother, its not that hard to request or ask us nicely to have us remove our shoes. Pointing with your finger + your rude face is not a appropriate way to engage with your customer. I hope that the attitude of this trainer needs to be corrected, if not the gym reputation will definitely be affected by him."
Clean and spacious warehouse gym in the heart of Petaling Jaya fully equipped with everything one would need to achieve their fitness goals. Multiple squat racks and spacious free weights area. Ample parking and friendly staff too.
"I’ve been here for almost 3 months and so far I’m loving the experience. They have the best facility, great environment and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this gym!"
"The gym is really good, has lots of different equipment and  their staff is really friendly. The personal training also is awsome especially Dr.chris wu, as a beginer i was first  a bit overwhelmed with the idea of working out but with his guidance and support i started loving it and i am seeing loads of progress so far."
"Variety of equipments that are in good condition. Whole area is well ventilated. Easy parking. Clean bath room.
I went in the afternoon. I believe it will look much better at night with all their lightings on."
"Very spacious, well maintained equipment. Only small complaint is the changing room sometimes very smelly, would appreciate if can spray air freshener or something once in a while."
"Parking during peak hours has turned from bad to worse. Just look at the illegal road side parking.
Lockers without lock panel and expect the member to carry the bag throughout the training???
Dressing room with camera due to one incident???
Bad song choice is subjective but deafening volume??? Trying to turn the gym into pub???
The management of this gym lacks common sense"
"5 stars on their personal training program, price is reasonable and coaches are world class

5 stars on their gym environment with all beautiful and friendly members who clean up machines after using

5 stars on gym membership price"

"I would like to take this opportunity to thanks my most pretty and fun PT - Lisa.
Before this I used to have few PT but at the end the result is not my expected. After I meet Lisa, she is so patience on teaching me about the training posture, workout information and diet meal.
After I train with her, I'm so surprise that my result is my unexpected.
Lisa really a good, nice and responsible :)"

Been to many gyms around the PJ area but Kfitness remains my favourite. It’s a very complete setup with various machines and multiple squat racks which makes my gym sessions very smooth sailing. Love the open air atmosphere which is breathable and not too hot. Looking forward to continuing my fitness journey with them
Hands down best place to workout for a cheap price (RM15 walk in). Has more equipment than all the other gyms I’ve been to. Clean and well maintained as well. No AC but ventilation is great.
"Good PT training, push you towards your goal. Sufficient equipments and very welcoming."
"I love this gym. This gym is very clean. Good Personal Trainer, best big gym in Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur"
Great place to workout. Fully functional equipments and great staff.
"Great gym. Spacious car park. Just look for the gym logo, it's easier to find the place. Entry rates vary at non-peak and Peak hours. A must go gym for all fitness enthusiasts"
"I like this gym so much. Price is cheap for such fully equipped big gym.
They are very strict on SOP, probably because of this, all members clean their machines or bench right after using.

Gym is clean as I see their cleaners cleaning it every time I come. Their personal trainers are professional from my conversation with them as I plan to engage them.

Overall, it is a really good gym with a lot of beautiful people."
"The big guy at the counter very Lan Si...

Everything is fine, equipment and environment are very good. The fee also affordable."
"best hype underground gym I've been to so far. try it to believe it!

this gym is huge, spacious & they have all of variety of equipments.

their staffs are also very friendly & experienced on training their clients. highly recommend! 💪

best part is, they only charge rm10 for walk-ins.
parking is easy too as they have over 100 of parking lots outside, need not worry about finding a place to park. 😁"
"Great experience starting my first gym in Kfitness. It is an open gym located near Seksyen 51A PJ. Started my membership when they were newly open in the year 2019. Was very new to gym workouts and how the machine operates. Due to great coaches and experience friends I met in KFitness, they guided me with proper ways to handle the equipment and also some new workouts along the way. You can even ask questions from the coaches on certain things you are not familiar or workouts that you have been doing but yet to achieved any result. Besides, the space and high ceiling really make the place comfortable and cooling. I would definitely encourage people whom is new to fitness to try out this gym. Happy Workout Everyone and stay fit together."
"One of the best underground gym around that is extremely affordable. Cheap walk in rate at RM10 or 1-2 credits on ClassPass . Plenty of parking space for just RM1 per entry. Gym is big ,spacious and very well equipped.

Training under the head coach Dr Chris is probably one of the best decision you can do for yourself. He is a professional fitness trainer catering to your fitness goals, whether for overall health longevity or fat loss, he is definitely the trainer to look for. The other personal trainers such as Andrew and Julian are just as good and professional. Find one that suits you and vibes well with you.

Changing room is huge and spacious.

Overall the gym has very good vibes, good lighting, nice layout and professional team to run the operation."
"after a few months of being lockdown , i found a very comfortable place to build my muscle again. This gym is great with complete equipment and nice ambient . thanks to everyone specially Mr.chris  who welcomed me on my first visit and i decided to sign up straightaway."
"I have been to this gym for a month and I found that they are very consistent in cleaning and sanitizing the gym, I heard they clean/sanitize twice a day, every day.

I like their crowd here, a good ratio between guys and girls. So I feel comfortable wearing shorts and sports bra only to train.

This gym is very big, with full fletch new equipment, and their design is unique with very good lighting set up.

My friend engage with their personal trainer and she slim down alot and manage build her shape also. Heard from her that it is one of the finest program.

Overall I would definitely recommend trying. Probably the best gym so far"
"Great place for a workout, plenty of parking spaces available."

There are many good looking fit girls and guys there training, hot girls and guys are everywhere in the gym for you to wash eyes :)

The gym is very clean, toilet is big and super clean also which is important for me. Their personal trainers are professional and passionate about coaching, price is standard but value is beyond standard.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Professional Personal Trainers
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good Vibe
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lighting and Instagram-able

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hot guys and girls"
Gym is clean and spacious. Equipments are quite complete. Worth the RM 15 per entrance. Great songs selection.
"Easy going gym, space is big enough, won't worry much on the social distancing issue."
"Need to submit 5-stars review here on Google or Facebook to get your RM150 registration fee waived.

Equipments are mostly ok. Space are quite limited to be honest, especially when there are many people.

Don't expect customer service here because it is basically non-existent. No one is there to bring you around on your first visit or introduce you to the space."
Awesome gym! Definitely will pick this gym! Nice environment!
"The environment here is just superb, all equipment are new and functioning.

Gotta shout out to Lisa Yoo the Trainer there, she is very patient in drilling the correct technique and posture of all exercise to her client, and always emphasis on Form over Volume.

If you would like to look for a Professional PT, I`ll definitely recommend her as your first choice ."

really friendly staff and kind to production team when we need to use the gym setting to shoot. really recommend 5 stars!
Awesome environment! Good vibes for gym junkies
"Very self-aware crowd, especially during these Covid-19 times. Everything is sanitiser after each individual use and there's also a max cap on the number of people allowed in the gym at any one time. In terms of the gym facilities, it had everything you could ask of a gym and more. Very vibrant and would highly recommend."
K Fitness gym is different than the other gyms I been previously. equipments top notch. spacious.clean. the staffs are all very friendly and helpful including the personal trainers such as Chris and a few others.
"This is the best gym i have been to so far of my fitness journey. Their head coach Chris is by far the best coach i have ever meet , always back up his point with relevant studies and reason behind.

"I not very well and long engaging with the fitness, but I did join 3 gyms in my previous years, Anytime fitness, chi fitness, 7 days fitness, none of it give me the reason to stay. However I find the environment especially the staff here is different, they greet you every time you come, checking out how is your training, helping you if you have fitness questions, it makes me feel like my second home, is no longer just cold machine with you on it and swing yourself. Well, equipment here is good, place is big, and is fun here. Yes, you can always hear some laughing here😄"

The way she communicate with me gives me a lot of motivation to go further in the workout as well in life. She's very dedicated in what her do as she trained herselves everyday to keep her body fit. She's being able to be not just a good personal trainer but also as a friend and a workout partner which is everyone needed. As for that, i strongly recommended her as ur personal trainer if u guys really want to achieve something in fitness world."
"I would like to take this opportunity to share with u guys the experience of training with my most pretty n professional trainer —— LISA YOO.

"I trained legs with Lisa in Kfitness a while back. Needless to say my legs felt like jelly right after and I couldn't walk for the next few days. Very effective workout as she provides a very in-depth knowledge and guidance on how to hit different part of each muscle group. Tired of your chicken legs, look for Lisa at Kfitness. Want a body fit for magazine cover, look for Lisa at Kfitness. She motivates you and pushes you beyond your limit and prioritizes proper form and technique over just lifting heavy.
