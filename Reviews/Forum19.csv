reviews
"This place has been my go-to place to play table tennis and badminton.

Amazing place for all types of athletes. Facilities are maintained nicely and are of high quality.

Bookings and reservations can be done on their website which is very convenient. Just come and play.

The place is fully cashless so you must have online transactions ready to buy the drinks."
"Sports building - mainly for badminton, also have courts for futsal and ping pong tables. Badminton courts - rubber mats. The place is huge. TouchNgo and cashless parking. Besides got muay thai."
"Muat Thai
Table tennis
Badminton
Futsal
Vending machine, changing room & surau.

In one place.
Plenty of parking.
Beside petrol station, near Perodua Sentral."
"Nice space for badminton and other activities such as Muay Thai, futsal, ping pong , gymnastics+

Inside got a shop can help service the racquet"
"(Badminton) Courts look new, clean n tidy.
Almost always full at night. Lighting is a little bit (just a little bit) dimmer than some other courts I've been to.
Need more benches for players to put stuff.
Overall, the courts placement is spacious enough."
"Great place for table tennis (7 tables), quite a lots of badminton courts & 2 futsal courts. Parking available onsite. Reasonable rate & good ventilation with showers available."
"Still one of the best courts in PJ. Lighting is sufficient, spacing between courts, sitting area, quality of the mat - all kept pretty consistent through the many years playing here. Sure, it leaks during heavy rain and it gets real humid at times, but the management has been helpful to swap and replace courts when necessary."
"Cheer up! Players. One place for Futsal, ping pong and badminton. The courts here are neatly maintained and badminton courts are suitable for beginners, intermediates and experts. Recommended to make badminton court bookings atleast one week before if you want on weekdays. On Weekends you may get the courts one or two days in advance. Certified badminton coaches are also available if you need training.
This place also has wrestling area.
*One can rent/buy rackets here in case if you do not have one.
*Shuttles, Handle grips, t-shirts and shorts are available to buy.
*Water bottle and energy drinks are also available.
*Restrooms are available to change clothes and to take shower.
**Futsal players are allowed only with the proper Futsal shoes. No football shoes are allowed inside court.
**For badminton you are allowed to play with sports shoes as well but recommended to play with the non-marking shoes.

Released sweat here and i certainly enjoyed the moments with friends around. The only down side is that the parking is not free for users and its not easy to find sometimes!
Good place to play table tennis. They have many tables. And best of all open air.
"Nice sports centre with many activities, parking here is about RM1 only."
Ventilation terrible. Feel very stuffy compare to my challenger pj especially the inner courts. But their cushioning are well kept.
"Nice place for indoor sports... all in one centre... Futsal, Badminton, Ping pong and Muay Thai"
Good during weekends. Parking is ample and reasonably priced courts. Ventilation is decent
"This is one of the best place I have played table tennis. They have a full cashless parking system with debit/credit and touchngo card features that is very convenient. Besides, a lot of parking spaces was available and not far from the entrance. The downside only is table tennis area have an uneven flooring that disrupt movement when playing."
Good place to play a variety of sports. Can book online. Badminton indoor courts can become a bit hot if crowded.
nice place to work out.... muay fit / badminton / ping pong / futsal all here
Easy to find parking and reasonably priced badminton court session here. Toilet is clean (very important). Lastly easy to just book and pay online.
"Fantastic place, clean and well maintained, they even have the famous MMA gym here, loving the vibe~~!"
"nice futsal place. got 2 futsal court n around ten badminton court. got all amenities. shower room, toilet and surau"
Reasonable pricing but court a bit small. Booking was very easy through an online website!
Typical old building with modern rubber court... There's only like 10 courts available for badminton games
It is near to my house.First time booking Badminton court here.Easy parking.Only  two badminton is being used during my game.We left after 1 hour.
"Building roof leaking!! When it have raining, it makes the floor wet and slippery. I sprained ankle cause of that. And I noticed there are few courts also having same issues. Fix the roof please!!

Latest update: They have arranged contractor to amend it ASAP. Good response from them. 5 stars to Forum 19"
Futsal courts are ok. Parking is always full.
"Nice place, has a car wash, basketball court, table tennis and many badminton courts. Just be careful with the online ordering system, we had a clash so it helps to call to confirm."
"Excellent MuayFit operation at Forum 19. Good facilities, strong trainers, variety of disciplines."
"Used to be best court in PJ for badminton, but now the roof always have leaking issue during raining day.

Update: they contacted me and promised will inform the contractor to fix the issue asap and offer 2 hours free session."
Must pay parking by touch & go but machine problem. Also if want but water or something must use e-wallet. Cash not accept.
"The court is well maintained and ventilation is not bad. Don't feel stuffy at all. Overall I'll give it a 8/10. The only downside is you HAVE to pay for parking. For a 2hr session on a Saturday, I had to pay an additional rm5 for parking.."
"good thing is all using cashless , so better have some money in your TnG for parking ."
Playing badminton & table tennis here with friends. Nice open air surrounding for playing table tennis but lacking the air ventilation for badminton court's area. I suggest the management to look on this matter for the convenient of users in the future. Thanks.
"Court are ok, recently the pricing has went up again. Rm43 for 2 hours on weekend morning, previously was rm40.

Ventilation is not really there, can be improved further."
"Good place to play badminton and futsal. Price is slightly above average. They also have to improve their ventilation as the badminton courts is a bit too warm. And yeah, good luck finding parking after 7pm"
i went for badminton..nice rubber n court
This place is a place where they have tons of sport facility. From having a badminton court with over 20courts of it and have 2 football area for you to play in. They also have around 7 ping pong table for a reasonable  price of 6.50rm and hour its worth it. In terms of drink price its quite pricy 2 bottles of 100plus may land at rm6 so better go to a nearby gas station 1min from the store which is driving towards the right hand side.
"Futsal court is quite sticky in my opinion, not rly the best surface to play futsal on but it is cheap and it is at a very centralised area at PJ.

The badminton court on the other hand is fantastic. It is always clean and it always looks brand new."
Good place for sports. Parking is available... remember to validate at counter for free parking....but futsal court is small..n the ball is average...really bouncy...well at least you can practice your 1st touch
Awesome place for futsal training and game.
"A strategically located sports center with facilities for futsal, badminton, table tennis, Carrom, Muai Thai, etc. Paid parking is available. There are plenty of seats for resting before, between or after games. The staff members are friendly and helpful. Mineral water and soft drinks are on sale. Memberships are available. Although it's my first visit and I hadn't tried out all the facilities, I must say that I would recommend it to my friends and family members."
"We stayed at the hostel for about a week and I must say the venue is kept very clean and tidy. The parking was free when you stay in the hostel and staff were all very friendly. May I suggest to have vending machines so tat players can get food when they r hungry, hair dryer and preferably another water drinking machine on d hostel floor. TQ."
Clean hall. Courts are well arranged and not too close with each other. They even have a place outside for those who wants to sit and wait for their partner to finish their exercise regime. Strict SOP followed.
"The rate here is slightly expensive. Me and my friends would normally visit Sport Planet Ampang for badminton which charges RM25 flat rate for member. The hourly rent here on weekdays after 6PM is RM28++ but I can't see how it should be more expensive here. It varies here though, being RM23++ for weekend.

The parking in Sport Planet Ampang is free whereas here, it costs RM1 for the first hour and RM 2 for each subsequent hour if you enter before 6PM. Else, after 6 it'll be RM2 flat rate.

We made the mistake of booking a court at 6PM and ended up paying RM5 for parking each car. So if you do come here, do be aware.

The facilities here feels much better maintained though. I didn't visit the toilet here but the one in Sport Planet is sort of dirty. The badminton court arrangement is so much better although both suffers from poor ventilation.

If it weren't for the expensive parking charges, I'd given this a 5 star rating."
They have various courts under one roof
"They have futsal, ping pong, badminton etc... Quite numerous courts too.."
Good facilities for badminton
"Futsal, badminton, table tennis (ping pong) and carrom facilities available. Also has a car wash you can leave your car at while you exercise. Can validate your parking ticket at the counter for free parking. Drinks available for purchase. Small sports shop available with badminton merchandise. Even provide recycling bins👌"
"Rubber court. No fans at the side. Hot for spectators, good for players hahaha"
"The badminton courts are nice, although it can be quite crowded inside. Easy to find the courts with Maps or Waze and not to far for people living in the KL/PJ area."
"Various sports selection including muay thai, badminton, futsal, table tennis, and basketball."
"Within PJ area, Forum 19 has one of the better courts for badminton. Though slightly pricier than the nearby courts, I would still prefer this location.

Other than badminton, Forum 19 also caters for table tennis and futsal, also a kickboxing gym if not mistaken. Parking is generally free. Personally, my Top 3 choices for badminton. 😁

Additional plus point is its location to nearby eateries such as burger lab, nasi lemak bumbung, etc."
Parking is not free. Court is good.
the best place in PJ for Futsal
"Nice place to play badminton. Reasonable price. The compound is clean and well maintained. Surau is provided for muslims. If you are keen to play futsal, you can book it at RM180 for 2 hours (quite cheap for KL price)."
The court is still relatively new compared to other court within the area. Quite well ventilated without much disturbing wind that might effect the play of badminton. Recommend if you willing to pay a bit more compared to other.
Quite nice place but the futsal court was slippery. Be careful while playing.
Great place to play badminton for those around Asia Jaya/Taman Jaya area
"Parking space is actually quite a lot...but due to its popularity too many people drive there to exercise. best to arrive before 7pm to find car park.

There is a Datok Gong Shrine too for those who wanna pray to him for good luck. The joss sticks, Oil, Lamp, Kemanyan etc are all donated by devotees who exercise in this place. feel free to take 3 joss sticks from a small tub at the left side of the shrine to offer Datok Gong. if you feel inclined to bless back Datuk Gong, pls buy joss sticks, candles, oil etc to put back into the tub to keep the blessing on going so that others too can use for praying."
its a good place for sport and also provide enough utility such as easy to parking.
The futsal court isn't that we'll maintained and the ventilation in the badminton court was pretty bad. Prices are decent and parking can be quite easily found though the car park fee is quite expensive.
"Badminton courts are overpriced, but they do have some of the better court surfaces
Futsal courts are cheap but occasionally poorly maintained"
Futsal courts quite well maintained. I liked the open air environment which provides freshness. Free parking is a great service to customers.
Decent Futsal courts. Decent prices. Only downside is that there are only 2 courts and parking can get full on some days.
"Interesting variety of sports facilities. MuayFit, Many Badminton Courts, 2 Futsal courts, Many ping pong tables and even has a place for rhythmic gymnastics. Recommend to go here to play."
Good badminton/futsal court and free parking can be claimed at the counter before exiting the location.
"Public space for sports that is still affordable. Good for badminton, Futsal, and they have training conducted there also. There is also a mixed martial arts training there"
Classy sports Centre with reasonable rates and ample of subsidized parking fees. Toilets are clean and well maintained.
The court really superb.... but they didn't follow the SOP COVID19 !!!! Customer have to do self temperature!! No staff there. In 10 customer 3only take temperature!!!! My self complain to the staff.... but they ignored.  Hope the MANAGEMENT take action!!!!
