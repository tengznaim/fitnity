"Grest court, great people, got public toilet too, a lot of shops nearby"
"Decent basketball court that is maintained from time to time. Good amount of people playing, the only problem is you probably need to bring your own friends because people who have their own teams will probably hog the court for quite some time."
"Pretty nice court. Ain't gonna lie, but like when it rains the shelter is of kinda of no point, cause when it pours heavy the court gets wet. But it's a nicely situated court. Food stalls, tons of them."
"Court is nice, the spotlight here are pretty bright, when you stand right under the rim, look up, hit right on your face by the spotlight, the floor is slippery, would wet when heavy raining(water splash in), and sometimes would have some rare pro-player visit. But also, this court is famous with people fighting, just like a fight club, yeps, players kinda over serious sometimes cuz you wouldn't wanna lose the game because you will need to wait long long time until ur next game, cuz this court is super crowded."
"Great place with good rims and mesh.  Has a over head cover to block out the sun. Meet some friendly players for a pick up game. Only thing to improve would be the floors are a bit slippery."
"Good clean basketball court for mostly teenagers practicing as well as having games"
"Court condition can be improved. Floor's always dusty & slippery. One light bulb's burnt, making the court a bit dark & hard to play in"
"Lovely for school boy to hang around.. they never goes vandalism if they.r good in basketball..

Vandalism as I understand is if we kick or punch a public belonging without a valid reason"

"(Translated by Google) There are a lot of people, especially on weekends. Sometimes there are five teams in halftime. There are many people in the evening. The basketball court with the most people nearby has many masters. Do what you can

人多，尤其是周末，有时候半场能排五队，晚上有很多人，附近人最多的篮球场，高手很多。量力而行"
