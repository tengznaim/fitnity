"Our weekend destination for badminton matches. Excellent courts with ample lighting. They also have a good shop selling all the equipment related to badminton. Refreshment counter sells the required energy drinks"
"It's just very hot. The management should put more air ventilators. Just so hard to breath while inside. No parking inside too. The roads leading into the court are always blocked with cars parked both ways."
"Just a normal badminton court, nothing much to comment about. Mostly about the environment.

Bad parking spots, tight space, one way In and you gotta reverse out.

Slightly dirty toilet, won't be comfortable to take a shower there.

First and last time here."
"Small court, not of standard size. No parking .Did stringing here, and the string broke after just one game. It was bg65 string that I had bought here. IT'S A fake."
"Not the best place to play badminton, as there are better ones nearby. Parking space is limited, and the rubber courts are a little oldish."
"Got my racket restrung by Uncle Krishna at the only badminton shop in this badminton center. It took only 20mins and done perfectly."
"Be careful of your car when you park inside their car park. My friend's car hitted by this New Vision's van driver and he refused to admit. Very bad attitude!!"
"Flooring is rubber so you'll have good grip. Parking is limited so you'll likely park outside. I personally do not like that the courts are so close to each other side by side and more so in parallel. So you see people moving around behind your opponent. Toilet is also serviceable but has definitely improved in terms of hygiene."
"Nice place for badmitnon. Ventilation is not bad. Not too hot n cold. Parking here alot as well. Court is clean but slightly old. Price is very reasonable. Overall good. Better than some other courts in the area..."
"Really enjoy playing badminton here, but it's quite hot when afternoon."
"One of the many badminton courts in the PJ area. There are several pros and cons about this court. Generally ok to play at and the hours are quite long, until 2am.

Some of the Pros are 1) easy to book via the AFA App which also means you can pay via GrabPay and get points, 2) allow for 30mins extension only at the court, not via the app, 3) parking is free and not as busy as 222 but can be quite dark at night as the roads seem to be in construction for the longest time.

On the other hand, some of the cons are 1) the courts are a bit run down, some nets are not well tied, 2) the court spacing is very limited, not great for SOP, 3) the toilets are a bit out dated and located on the outside of the court area so if it's raining it's really not convenient

Price wise is standard, RM28/hr for weeknights. They have promo for the weekends RM30 for 2 hours if booked under the AFA App with the code (AFA - NVBA - wepromo). This is as of 28 December 2021, picture attached, not sure if it's applicable anymore."
"I've been playing at this place for some time. Court wise is great(rubber court) . Only problem is the parking . It has limited parking spot here, you might need to park outside and it might be far"
"Hot place for badminton but the court pricing is so affordable."
"Not a great place to play badminton at. Parking spaces are very limited, few courts and no option between wooden parquet flooring and green rubber flooring. Rates are quite expensive and the space can get pretty crowded when fully booked due to the small hall and courts that are lined up very closely (to the point where there are almost zero space to walk between courts. Toilets are very dirty and unrepaired. Hardly any sanitisation is seen."
"Nice badminton court, good lighting."
"Badminton court can be booked over WhatsApp or over a call. However, payment needs to be transferred once booking is confirmed.

Joshua at the counter will make sure your booking is there for you!

Parking is not horrible but you have to park at the side of the road. So there will usually be parking. Just walk walk."
"15 courts available and even in weekends, some courts are free, 5 mins walk to bus station, near with shopping malls and Church.
There is training club for kids and adults. One month fee (4 times) is RM140 for ‚Ä¶"
"Parking space is very limited. Court is good."
"Just played today after a while. Surprised to see the well organised MCO SOP and great care for the players by providing nice social distancing sitting. Parking a little tight inside but can park outside the court area. We also got some good badminton tips from their local pro, Coach Yogendran. Its like the golf driving range where you have local pro for advice.  Court price are among the lowest in the area and lighting is bright and we got the new rubberized court."
"Nice facility. You can book court via AFA apps which very useful."
"Good and friendly staff. Bookings are availbale for morning sessions."
"Bad experience, first time book this court, when all of us reach then told us no court for us. üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº We called and confirm booking all, when we reach there, they told us no court. And said that now they only booking thru online, very irresponsible of them for taking our booking in the firs place."
"Parking is pretty bad so just park on the street. Decent price for weekends (RM15/hr) and the shop is able to restring your racquet in 20mins."
"i think that good place.
as a following they, before booking needs to things.
but it is not difficult.
if you have a little brave. please do call for this place."
"Serves the purpose. Area is relatively small, courts are packed up next to each other with only inches apart. Court poorly ventilated. Parking cramped & inconvenient. Customer service has communication/language issues."
"Got wind and less parking"
"The price is cheaper compared to the others in the vicinity. As usual, the carpark is not sufficient inside but there's ample carpark available in the surrounding. The only downside is that the court are too close to each other."
"Around 15 badminton courts to book and play, atmosphere inside very warm like free SAUNA! Nevertheless great place for badminton and store for Drinks, badminton accessories ready"
"Play there every week. Price is reasonable. Can be cheaper. Courts are not too bad too with enough space in between to not be considered crowded."
"It's very meh.. most of the reviews here pretty much sums up my accumalated experiences here too. It's not fantastic, but it's not that bad either. The badminton shop here is alright. Like the guy working there is very nice so that's a decent experience."
"Cheap place. However its always fully book when we want to book. Hence, for those who wan book better book for full month as priority come to those who book monthly. However, if you have to urgent cancel, staff there are a bit rude and they might ban you from future booking."
"Need dire renovations. Lack of ventilation and court lines need to be redone. Not adhering to SOP seeing as number of ppl per court."
"very nice place for badminton play...this here got parking place also..."
"Hardly u can find parking here, but the inner renovation is good though. The location also easy to find."
"Difficult to find parking unless park outside of main road... court condition doable but lighting not too good."
"Went there last sunday 8-10 pm for RM30 . That‚Äôs cheaper than any court in pj tho. Parking is alright , tho i would advice you to carpool to the place as it might get crowded during peak hour ."
"15 rubber courts. Good lighting. Limited parking. Ventilation can be improved."
"Great and amazing place to play and practise.. Best part is court can be booked over a call and pay once you finish playing.."
"Affordable price if go in a group of more than 4 per court."
"Rude staff. I had to cancel my court reservation due to emergency circumstances, and the staff in charge told me to never book again *thumbs down*"
"Not enough lightings, very humid and hot, limited parking, 15 courts available, cheaper price to rent a court"
"The guy working there is rude and the rates online were outdated -
It was RM 10 for student price but it has increased to RM 12.
And it was RM 15 for adult but it has increased to RM 17.

The rates have changed since 2017!!! but the online rates continue to mislead patrons. It is 2019, please change your rates.

My students had to fork out additional money because the employee gave a sour face when we told them about the outdated information. The employee should at least apologise for the misinformation. So rude.

I have posted a picture with the correct rates on the Google Photos side. Hopefully no one else gets conned.

Also, parking and entrance is an issue. Only one entrance and limited parking."
"Sweating it out! There's a place for a quick bite. Probably should buy water and isotonic drinks outside though, as it's quite expensive here."
"the line has been replaced with new one but old stain still rather visible and in close proximity with new line which makes it harder to estimate"
"A very good place to train with amazing and experienced coaches. Players also come from different countries to train here."
"Good place to play badminton. I'm not sure about other facilities."
"Wonderful place to get trained.The training is really intensive.Worth every penny."
"Friendly customer service! I just have lil bit issue with parking space for car, suggest you guys sharing car or using motorcycle to come here üëç"
"the ventilation here was not so good, but the court is nice"
"Not enough car parks inside. Must park our car very far away."
"One of the oldest courts. Suffers from poor maintenance and insufficient parking."
"The price for the badminton court is about average. The courts are pretty packed together and the rubber flooring is pretty decent. Parking may be an issue to some especially during this time of the writing, there are constructions ongoing on the roadside which greatly limits the parking options."
"Nice place & affordable. Managed by friendly people"
"Walk in for court. Staff said open till 12am. 5 min later another staff tell me court closed. Worst service ever"

"Heavy sweat smell & stuffy.  But the price is reasonable"
"Parking is non existent, very limited unless you double park. Inform the guy at the counter if you double park. The badminton courts look run down and some courts tearing up apart. Net height is also incorrect.
Not much seats available between courts to rest due to the tight space between court to court."
"HI Everyone,  can anyone tell me how can i joint the badminton clud to play badminton weekly.  Many thanks"
"Parking is damn hard to find"
"The courts were aplenty but the problem was the lack of parking spots. Everything else is pretty standard of badminton courts"
"We have our badminton session every Thursday. At first we have our slot at 9pm but now, we have been over to 930pm slot due to a badminton practice session. That is all fine. But sometimes for the 2 courts we've booked, one is not available at time we've BOOKED."

"Good place for badminton session"
"A little pricey"
"My friend had booked two courts on last Friday for 8-10pm. When we arrived arround 7:50pm, we are notified that there's no courts available for us. Even our name is written on their booking calendar!
The staff just tell us that ""hanya pukul 9 ada. u mau ke tak mau?"" with a ridiculous rude attitude.

It was my most unpleasant experience ever for Badminton games. I used to frequent here as their Saturday night sessions has a very cheap price. But not anymore since last week!

And without any bias, I would comment that the quality of the court is just so-so. Courts have no issue, but cleanliness and ventilation is bad."
"Been calling them since 11am till 6pm on a Wednesday but no one picks up the phone at all :/"
"They sometimes overbook you but it's still a good facility"
"Amazing Badminton facility for great coaching & training !!!"
"The court too close & flooring need to do maintenance"
"Strategic location to play, court size smaller than standard, less parking space"
"Poor customer service.
Be careful of court7&8 as there's a usual group of Indian customers who use that court on Sunday afternoons between 2-3pm but have poor hygiene control.
One man in particular sweats like mad till his sweat is all over the floor next to the court and doesn't even bother to clean up after himself even after being told off even though it stinks so badly.
What's worse is that the badminton academy court caretaker cum cashier will only pretend to listen to your complaint about this matter but not do anything afterward."
