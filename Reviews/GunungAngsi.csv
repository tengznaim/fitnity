Nice trail with some steep scrambles. Would be very slippery in the rain
hike on monday after rain.fog and cool .just us and nature! however the trail heavily affected with trampling effect and vandalism at the peak
"Will definitely come again. En route to the entrance, the road is pitch black. 4 km of going uphill and you will arrive at the entrance. It is safe to park your car on the sides of the road. Mosque, toilet available. …"
"The first 30-40 mins of the hike is steep, but it becomes easier after that. The trail is very clearly marked, and takes about 1.5 hours to get to the top. The view from the top isn't fantastic, however (the view from Gunung Datuk is much …"
"Went the day after pouring rain. There were two routes and we took the easiest route via Bukit Putus. The trails were expectedly muddy and slippery due to the downpour previous day. Nevertheless, a relatively easy hike with minimal slopes and defined walking trails. Took us less than 1.5 hours to the peak and another hour to descend. Strongly recommended for beginners."
"One of the famous training ground for hikers in Negeri Sembilan.
You can start from
1. Bukit Putus  approx. 2 hours
2. Ulu Bendul  approx. 1~ 1.5 hours
3. Trans Angsi (start from either way  10 KM + 3 KM tar road)"
"UPDATE: Trail head upgraded with steel stairs and the trail has been cleared of fallen trees. Kudos to the Negeri Sembilan forestry department for the upkeep.

Getting what you want is simple but it was never easy. Gunung Angsi via Bukit Putus. There's fairly maintained toliet at the trail head. Not much view here but I enjoy the cool breeze while hiking"
"Quite a good hiking experience, sadly ulu bendul route have been closed due to undergoing maintenance else it will be more interesting and challenging. Will be back someday once ulu bendul route reopen."
Nice
"During MCO, entrance is allowed only at Bukit Putus. The beginning of track is steep but wide enough to allow hikers to pass each other. The track is clearly visible from start to finish, so less confusing.

From entrance to the peak the distance is about 4km which takes between 1.5 to 2 hours. There is some space at the peak to take photos, although it was crowded that Saturday morning.

On the way back my friend & I purposely took different route which was more difficult and longer. There were huge fallen trees that blocked some track which made it more difficult. We reached Ulu Bendul exit 3 hours later & then walked back 2.5km to the entrance.

In short I like this trail which I consider moderately difficult and does not require too much time to complete."
"Entrance fee of RM5. 2 routes to reach the peak. I went via Bukit Putus, which takes slightly over 2h to ascend and around 1.5h to descend. The incline at some parts of the trail is very steep, but works up a good sweat."
"'Gunung Angsi' -
Located in Tanjung Ipoh, District of Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan Darul Khusus. Situated in Ulu Bendul Recreational Forest about 20km from Seremban City.
At the height of 875m (2702ft) above the sea level, it's the 3rd highest peak after Gunung Datuk and Bukit Bintongan which are both slightly higher.
There're several entrance trails to reach the summit depence on your fitness...
1.Bukit Putus Trail - short and easy climb, track distance about 4.5km and duration in 1- 2 hours to reach the peak.
2.Ulu Bendul Trail - slightly challenging and longer, the duration in 3 hours and track distance about 8km.
Gunung Angsi is the popular hiking/climbing spot, relatively short but steep. Need to register and pay RM5/person before hiking up through the forest reserve that's rich with various of tropical trees like Meranti, Damar Hitam, Terap, Mersawa, Keruing and etc.
At the peak of Gunung Angsi the views partially observed by trees and bushes but if the weather is clear you can see the nearby mountains like Gunung Telapak Buruk, Gunung Datuk and Gunung Tampin. You can also look over the surroundings area and the town of Kuala Pilah. 👈 🤗"
Nice hiking place... cool breeze in the morning
Nice place to enjoy sightseeing with friends and family
Good experience for me and my little one.
"This expedition is preparation for us before go to Gunung Nuang..this expedition ideal for beginners because of easy track. We can see many old man climb this mountain.we have little challenging because of rain. Very slippery..finally, we arrived within 2 hours.. Its good view when arrived at peak"
Nice hiking place .
one of the best place for hiking lover
Pro: The trail is good..con: lacking washroom & shower facilities..hope the relevant forestry dept. make more toilet & washroom for hikers & importantly maintain it properly..
"I went there yesterday, and it was quite crowded because aside from those small groups, there's a bus trip for hiking, okay well the route of bukit putus is shorter and I would say it is not very difficult. Easy to moderate. The peak is very wide and if you guys have hammock, you should bring it. The Ulu bendul waterfall and route are closed because it rains few days before, so to avoid any accident they close it plus its a bit extreme and longer route. Oh yeah from the entrance you must pay RM5 of permit. Just to keep track. So Goodluck for who's going."
Challenging climb. Good exercise.
Good trail for beginner
"A relatively short (but steep) hike through the jungle to the third highest peak in Negeri Sembilan. There are two routes: the Bukit Putus route is the shorter and more direct route, starting at an altitude of 285m. The Ulu Bendul trail is much longer and narrower, and is much steeper near the top (in a number of places there are sections of rope in place to help descend the slippery track). Nice views from the top, but nothing spectacular.

"Bukit Putus registration office right by roadside near right at the stairs (Bukit Putus trail entrance) more of a pondok. No signboard here, so be alert! Informed that registration should be done here even if entering from Ulu Bendul trail.

Staffs are helpful and friendly. Bkt Putus trail is obvious and straightforward. Denied entry through Ulu Bendul due to bad weather conditions."
Moderate trail for beginners via Bukit Putus and nice view at the peak.
nature at their best
Go very early to enjoy cool breeze and mist will definitely sweep your face

"Pace the speed of running 2 sketches 40 minutes-1 hour
pace bese2 1hr - 1hr 20min
2 hours slow pace

Keep our forest clean."
Gunung angsi dah boleh hiking ya. Hanya bayar permit RM 5.00 satu kepala. Sesuai untuk semua golongan umur. Dari kanak kanak sampai lah ke orang tua (lingkungan 55 tahun ke bawah ). Boleh lah datang sini balik untuk menikmati keindahan alam sekitar.
Incorrect info from the signboard..incorrect distance..trial starting climbs up ... for those who are used to hiking okay but to bring a family of children is not encouraged..if it rains the trial is slippery..it will fall on your seat.no repeat
Very suitable for xtvt hiking and waterfall bathing in dunung datok.
"climbing this mountain angsi best time weekdays because there are not many people at the top. My experience is to go up the trail of the broken hill and go down the hill. the trail to the top along the hill breaks in 5km, the trail is wide and easy but a lot of mud. If the trail is up to 7km, the trail is narrow and has to enter the gorge and cross the river. dah exit ulu bendul kena la jalan kat highway dlm 3km untuk ke parking kereta di enterance bukit putus 🤣

do not forget to buy a permit at the entrance"
"The track is quite challenging. If starting from Bukit Putus, the first 30 minutes really need strength because the route is quite steep.

It takes about 2-3 hours to reach the top for a slow pacer.

The Ulu Bendul route is further and challenging, but the scenery is very interesting. Need to start if you want to use this track.

Do not forget to register / report before starting the climb. One head RM5."
"Very attractive hiking area, clear track and no guide guide. just need a friend to help climb and avoid emergency things. A very beautiful mountain peak. The heart is peaking"
Not difficult to climb
2707ft
Be the focus on the weekend ....
Angsi mountain peak
😆
Lots of bees near the top
"Don't be fooled, it's not far away, it's a little jerk again, but mamg best is crazy when dh spi peak"
Extreme activities ... it's best to go with a group of friends ... 😅
Attractive places to visit in about 2 hours are required to reach the top
It's fun to climb. Among the mountains suitable for beginners because trail x is too difficult and not too high
How many times have I set foot on this peak. But there is no excuse. I'll go over again if there is a living.
"First of all, I went up, it must be ok."
Down the hill can go straight to the river bath
boiling 45 deg. I'm stupid. 2 hours not peaked.
Beautiful view .. x as many grandfathers
interesting hiking spot
