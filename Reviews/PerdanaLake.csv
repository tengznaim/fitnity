"Would be the best place to spend quality time with friends and family members. The evening could be more enjoyable than the morning because of the sunlight. In the evening it's become a gorgeous place that makes feels peace your mind. Is a great place for jogging, cycling, and walking. Saturday and Sunday become very crowded so make sure to maintain the proper SOP.
You do not need to pay any amount of money to get into this place, however, parking is very limited, you might have to park your car near the road at your own risk."
"Great jogging track.. unfortunately couldn't complete the track.. will do one day...
Not smelly.. parking road side is quite dangerous.. but it's ok...
Can hire cycle and beam scooter...
Great picnic spot as well..
Enjoy .."
"Love this plc. Can have a nice walk or jog by the lake side...its a long walk. Nice spots a lot the walk path to just sit and enjoy the lake view  or have picnic. Parking is along the road side... when i went it was a slow drizzld so not much people around.. but i fuess this place will be packed normal days. Go early."
"Located at cyberjaya. It's easy to find. I love it here. This place is hugely surrounded by a lake. Unlike other jogging tracks, you won't get easily bored. Here you can try to ride a scooter or a bike by tryke. The only disadvantage is there is no proper parking lot. You have to park at the side of the road."
"This is a good place for jogging. I arrived here around 7am for sunrise.Can come earlier to avoid crowd during weekend. TRYKE is available here for scooter and bicycle rental."
"Went for a casual evening and unplanned night right. The park is well maintained. Love the view and the wind at night.
On a side note, the Putrajaya Lake closes at 8pm (if I'm not mistaken) for public. So only the residents have access to the lake as it is located inside of their neighborhood."
"Very nice place for jogger and e-bike riding around the lake. There is Sunset point to view from lake. No crowded people around"
"Great place for walking, jogging, cycling, skateboarding, you name it, its nice here.

For those who are wondering how long does the track goes, here you go, its about 9.5km in average. You will need to walk pass some bridges to do so, but no worries, it have dedicated route for walking."
"Very nice place for family.. good place for outdoor walking n jogging and family bonding time. Nice view üòç only that no toilet n place to wash hand"
"I love this place. So serene especially at the wee hours of the morning. But tend to be crowded after 8 am"
"If u wish to use the Tryke make sure to check from the apps for the availability first, especially on weekends after 4pm. Normally they have a lot on weekdays. The track got nice view for jogging and cycling.

On the weekend, especially afternoon there'll be a long queue line to for the tryke."
"Super vibrant & healthy living. Crowded during weekend and public holiday, yet still plenty of space for everyone. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"Love to ride around the lake. Now they started to build fence around it which is really disturbing I really hope they will not try to make this a payed  entrance. That would be greedy and disgusting. It's a public land for more than a decade. Leave it open 24/7 and free."
"Outstanding place to enjoy with friends and family. It is really mind blowing. Welcome to Cyberjaya"
"Hidden Gem.. The place is magical.. Long running and cycle tracks, good breeze, on sundays u can rent normal cycles and other days trykes"
"It is really a good place to go for Jogging, walking and cycling. If you don't have bycycle you can take it for rent (0.50 RM for a minute).

You can complete the whole place in a single day even if you are jogging or cycling.

Natural beauty and greenary is the one which is really attractive here."
"With a beautiful colourful lights at night ... Can be chill n relax with loved one and also can do some workout like cycling jogging..."
"The best place to jog, bring family together, have rilexing, riding bicycle and enjoy the whether. Ride scooter and bicycle can up to at late night."
"Big lake, nice environment. Crowded but the space is big enough, not too worry about the social distancing. The down sides are the flying insects and also you need to be careful of the scooters and the bicycles as the riders are playing it in fast speed."
"Very nice place for walking and jogging"
"Amazing view for sunrise and also after sunset"
"Nice place to jog around. The view is relaxing and calming, greenery by the lake with expensive house at the side to be gawked upon. Track is well maintained. Lots of people in the evening, so try to come in the morning if that's not your thing."
"Nice place to jog, scooter and bonding with friend"
"Great place and fun e-scooter ride."
"This was my first time visiting to the Perdana Lake. I arrived at 7am and parked my car at the road side, the cycling lane to be precise as there were no designed parking area at this point, but it's pretty safe parking there I think, seeing quite a lot of people doing this.

I started running at around 7am, and the golden sunrise caught my attention making  me can't really focus on running that I kept taking pictures of it. It was a breathtaking scenery.

Numerous cyclists were cycling casually there, runners as well. You can go for a distance of 10km easily, or even up to a half marathon distance, or even more covering all of the tracks.

The track was pretty well paved and it was lit up before 7am and during night, for certain parts of it only, unfortunately. There were some tar roads partially with no lighting, so you might need to prepare some lightings during night or early in the morning before sunrise.

One thing I noticed was, there were no toilets or changing room around the entrance point. If you need it, you have to go further about 2km from the entrance to have one (please correct me if I was wrong).

Overall, it was a wonderful experience running there, with spectacular views, well paved tracks. Suitable for families, couples, cyclists, runners, skateboarders! Will surely visit again for running!"
"Well maintained. Not too crowded during weekends. I'll give 5 stars if there are water fountains like the one at KLCC.

Review 20 March 2022
Added one more star bcoz now they have a working 100plus vending machine."
"I love how peaceful the place is. It's perfect for long walks, jogging, cycling, picnic, meditation etc. The view is very nice."
"Nice place for picnic, strolling with kids, and of course, jogging! Do watch out for the scooters. Some folks will just zoom zoom zoom outta control üò∞"
"A picturesque and excellent place for jogging, brisk walking and cycling.

The lake are clean and well maintained. The jogging track are surrounded by the lake and beautiful and expensive houses scattered along the track

There are scooter and bicycles for rental. You can use them to cycle through the entire jogging tracks.

This place tends to be quite crowded during weekends. Hence better come early"
"Used to be my training ground, I was here way before the extensions to Putrajaya were build. A really nice place to jog, to run, to walk. Still come here occasionally to run a big loop to or from Putrajaya."
"Very chill and bigggggg lake"
"A good place for a walk or a jog in the morning or afternoon. The area is quite open, so it may be too hot for any activity when the sun is up.

The track is almost flat around part of Putrajaya lake. It goes through Ayer 8 and all the way to Seri Perdana Complex (PM's Official Residence) in Precint 10.

If you are cycling, please do not cycle too fast as there may be kids around."
"Great environment. Good place for riding and running."
"A great place to take a break by the lake, take an evening jog or just an easy going stroll and take in the breeze. Can get a bit crowded at times but the walking path is wide enough for physical distancing. Plants and trees are well groomed, benches are available and surrounding is clean and well maintained. You get a great view of Putrajaya office buildings across the lake and when the lights go up after night falls it sort of reminded me of Yeouido in mini scale"
"Nice view, got bicycle and scooter to rent,"
"I do see ppl smoking, vaping, bring their pet (dog/cat). It is very disturbing when u do physical exercise and inhaling smoke. Even disgusting when there is animal poo on the grass. I hope PJH can do something."

No restroom as well"

"Nice track to jog and walk.. fresh air always!!
My favourite place for a morning or evening stroll and jog.

People most likely come here for jogging, cycling, strolling or just enjoy the sunset calmness üòä.

The only thing lacking is that there is no washroom here.

There are some sheltered area for you to hide from the harsh sun. Lots of places to sit along the whole track.

The view of the bridge is fantastic during the day as well as night.

The calmness and serenity during sunset, dusk and night is exceptional.

The sunrise that you can see while facing the bridge is a thing you should not miss. Make sure you cone here early for sunrise reach by 7am to catch the sunrise üòåüòÅ."
"Great place to jog during the day. A great place to chill during the night to early morning. I've driven here late midnight and it's a good place to enjoy the air.

"Awesome place for early morning jog."
