"First of all the name is literal, the water is chilling!! Its a beautiful trail, super flat with little ups and downs and 6 different river crossings that make the journey to the waterfall super fun, all the while you can observe amazing schools of fish in crystal clear water streams, its just amazing. It's a must visit place, the waterfall is beautiful though it can get a little deep closer to the falls. Beware that the place will be super crowded since it only opens during weekends. As always, please ensure to bag and take all trash items with you on the way back. Enjoy!"
"Took about 1hour drive from KL to this hiking site, we didn't know that it is now open at 9am ~ 4:30pm.

The hike is super beginner friendly, but will have to cross the river 5 times to get to the waterfall, the water height is from knee to waist, so it is impossible not getting wet.

Along the way, enjoy the nature, sound of river flow. Cheers."
"Opens at 9AM. Amazing trail and river crossing. Recommend to wear sandals and use waterproof bag. No cooking allowed. Bring pre-cooked meals instead. Had to cross 5 rivers and 1 bridge to arrive at the waterfall."
"Very fun! Take about 1H to arrive at the waterfall. The track was easy, suitable for beginners. Open from 9am - 4pm

Ps
1. Bring wetshoes or rent in front (rm5/shoe)
2. Bring waterproof casing
3. Bring plastics for your rubbish
4. Buy fish food early at the entrance"
"Took me nearly an hour and 30mins from KL to Sungai Chiling Fish Sanctuary with both of my elderly parents aged 70+ on 19/06/2022. Reached at Sungai Chiling entrance at around 11pm. Managed to find a parking along the road side (unobstructed to moving vehicles) for free. The designated parking is limited and was full upon arrival. Not sure if parking fee is needed at the designated parking lot. After parking, passing via the main gate and walked around 5mins to the registration counter. One person from the group needs to register at the counter with full names, address, IC, time of hiking and signatures were required for each hiker. The counter officer will ask us to remember the number of the form and upon coming out from the hiking trail, need to report back at counter. At the moment, there isn't any entrance fee imposing on the hikers. The park currently only opens on weekend. The whole hiking might take about an hour plus plus (4km) depends how fast you are and need to cross 6 rivers in order to reach the paradise waterfall! The first one  was super easy as there was just a bridge to cross over. Second one was easy too with ropes fixed on the hiking trail. Third one started to be a bit difficult because there were lots of stones hidden in the river. The day before we went on Sunday had a heavy pour and that contributed to the level of difficulty of this hiking as the depth of the river became deeper with stronger currents! Lots of ikan kelah were seen in the river. Remember to store all your belongings in a waterproof bag as some of the hikers' phones were condemned due to water contamination. Crossing the fourth river was truly scary as the swollen river at chest level (for a 163cm adult height), strong river currents with lots of hidden stones became the big obstacles to us. Other hikers told us that the heavy pour on the previous day was the reason why the river water became relatively deeper with strong currents! With the helps of other hikers, we managed to make a safe crossing the fourth river. Some of the experience hikers advised us not to stay on the same side of the rope when crossing river. Should walk in pair on the opposite side while crossing the river. Well, we did try this method and found it quite effective if executed it carefully. Cautions is still needed. The fifth and the sixth rivers were relatively ok compared to the fourth river! After crossing the sixth river, we finally reached the base of the waterfall and was rewarded with breathtaking view. However it was crowded with hikers. We managed to find a relatively secluded spot away from the crowd to rest and have some light lunch while enjoying the view and taking some photos. No monkeys were seen. We were surprised to see lots of young children managed to overcome all the obstacles to reach the waterfall! For the time being, the counter officer informed us that after 12pm, they won't allow any hikers to get in and all hikers must report back by 430pm. If weather becomes cloudy, all hikers must be evacuated immediately. Despite there is a sign board erected to remind hikers not to climb on the rocks and dive, there were still some selfish and idiotic 'monkeys' to do so. I noticed some of the hikers were openly smoking in the park around the children. To make it worst, even the officers were smoking as well. I hope the authority will consider to ban smoking in the park that meant for the public to enjoy fresh air and healthy lifestyle. Toilets were only provided at the registration counter but the condition is very dirty. Hope some efforts to maintain it. We returned to the office at around 4pm. Even though, it was not an easy hiking especially after a heavy pour on the day before, we truly enjoyed it and I would recommend for others to try. Tips for hiking, never feel shy to ask other hikers to help to cross the river if you feel you are not confident to do it by yourself. Get a better hiking shoes and waterproof bag. Have a safe hike and bring back your own rubbish. Keep the park clean."
"Open on weekends. Must register at entry before hiking in. And register again before exit so they know if anyone is left. Water very clean and cold. Lots of fish. Can buy fish food there for rm5 a pack to feed. Please do not litter or make a mess. Currently open on trial basis to assess impact of visitors. So it may be closed or more limited if some makes a mess. Lots of visitors on May 28."
"We enter at beginning signboard entrance 8:30am but couldn't  enter the gate at guard hut because they announced that yesterday night downpour make the river water cloudy. They told us to come up again at 11am. Too long to wait, we just go to another hot spot within the area to picnic 🤗"
"Beautiful scenery as you walk to the waterfalls. We are moderately fit but we didn’t reach the waterfall in 45 mins as suggested by earlier reviewers. You need to cross the river and the water level will get you totally wet. Even walking there was a wet activity (lots of puddles which you cannot avoid) so wear the right shoes/sandals. Ricks are slippery. There are changing rooms at the start of the walk BUT long queues especially for the female bathrooms. One more thing….. fish everywhere. The river was thriving with fish which is a delight. If you want to bring your wallet and phone along during the hike, you need a waterproof bag or put them on your head. Haha."
"Reopen to public on 21 May 2022 after Covid (after so longgg~). Only Sat and Sun for now.

However the authority mentioned that this is a ‘trial’ and not a permanent decision yet. It will be evaluated by different organisation like KKM, enforcement etc and the visitors behaviour & obedient toward SOP will highly influence their decision in future.

So please please take care of Sg Chilling as though as it is our home. No rubbish. No vandalism. No disturbance toward the natural flora and fauna. Just enjoy the beautiful nature.

Sometime, there could be some undercover personnel from those authority to monitor visitors. Another visitor passing by you could be an enforcement officer.

In term of attire, good to wear water shoe as you are crossing the water for 5 times. There is shoe rental service at the entrance but they have limited sizing.

Bring some food/water and also something to keep your rubbish. There is no rubbish bin anywhere, bring home your own rubbish.

On the other hand, it is sad to know that the toilet are broken while we were there (despite closing for so long for ‘renovation’) Hopefully the person in charge will do something about it.

Overall, it is rather an easy hike with so much fun. In short, dont forget to wear proper shoe, bring some food to enjoy at the waterfall, drink & rubbish bag."
"It has been closed for 3 yrs and finally open again on 21 May 2022. DOF did a good job in breeding Malaysian Mahseer (ikan kelah or empurau). The most expensive river fish in Malaysia. Can see a lot fishes in the river even near the registration counter. Remember sign the registration form when finished the trail. Come as early as 9am. The last entrance is 12noon to waterfall. Reach later than 12noon, can play at campground. This place close at 430pm. Better walk back from waterfall latest 3pm.. Mosquito repellent and beach shoes are advisable. Muddy and stagnant water at the beginning. Took 1 hour 20min to walk to waterfall as stop for playing water awhile after trekking for abt 30min. Its a bit tiring, replenish is recommended and prepare to get wet abt 100cm from your foot and might be higher if water level is high. Only one shower room with two shower head behind the toilet. Two changing room at toilet. Cleanliness should be improved. Breathtaking waterfall, the best experience was when crossing the river 5 times."
"Come early in the morning at least 9:30am if u want to have a seat. Don't wear expensive shoes. Go buy at decathlon rubber shoes (rm20). U will regret it if u dont listen to me haha"
"I really had alot of fun feeding the fish, being in the river. It was quiet chilling.

Had to register to go in and no entrance fee.

Bring a waterproof hiking shoe it will help alot"
"Good place to chill during weekend. Better to come early to find a nice spot"
"Crossing river adventure, clear water, fish, powerful waterfalls, worth the half day work out.."
"As a person who loves nature..it's a great place to spent time with family on the weekends"
"Been here years ago and had a great experience, tried coming back on a Friday to discover that it was closed. It is only open on weekends and have edited the opening times to reflect that."
"Drive around one hour from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Kubu Bharu. Walk around 10 minutes to registration post. Another 30 minutes to one hour to the waterfall. Very nice place to rejunevate your body and soul. This is a protected area designated for Kelah (Malaysian Mahaseer). Please keep clean. No fishing. Please follow the instruction of the office/ranger."
"Very good location for family gateway. Only 1 hr away from city center with ample parking space. Be there early in the morning and register yourself at the office. Visitors need to leave the sanctuary/ waterfall by 4pm and take their trash together.

The waterfall is clean unlike others nearby. The hike to main waterfall is about 4km and we took around 1hr 15min to reach."
"A great place for picnic, enjoying the nature and playing with ""ikan kelah"". Only open on friday to sunday. From 8am. After 3pm not allowed to go the waterfall for safety reason. Have to cross river 6 times (one using bridge) before reaching the waterfall. Not recommended to go on rainy day as the water can go high."
"Totally worth it.
1) go early. I started the trail about 8.30am. Gets crowded after.
2) use rubber shoes,the black cheap ones. I wrecked my trekking shoes.
3) bring sandwiches. Easier and less headache.
4) compulsory swim in the final peak. Amazing!"
"Dubbed as one of the most impressive waterfalls in Selangor, it takes about an hour and a half of moderate hiking to get to the waterfall. The route will require you wade across the Chilling river 6 times, with ropes to help you balance without falling in. You will also find schools of fish swimming around the crystal clear river water that you can feed by buying fish food at the entrance."
"This place perfect for 1 day trip. I toke my cat there to enjoy the Mother Nature.

Entry fee: RM1.00 (Malaysian Ringgits)

Location: around 2:00 hours far from Kuala Lumpur.

You can’t overnight there. They close at 6:00 PM

I hope they improve the toilet."
"It is not so hard to find. Parking spaces could be added more, as many cars can be seen parked on the road shoulders. For elders who are unable to walk the distance, wheel chairs might be needed to reach to the river."
"Effective from 21 May 2022, the sanctuary will only open on Saturdays & Sundays and opening time will be from 9am - 4:30pm."
"7 Km north east from Kuala Kubu Bharu. Parking space is limited. Please come early ( be here before 8:30)

3 Km tracking in the woods. (About 45 minutes)

Clean and fresh."
"Edit: there is possibility that it is opened now on weekend. Please anyone update this.

My Disappointment Is Immeasurable And My Day Is Ruined when seeing the place is under renovation but not updated in Google review.  No website is provided so it hard to check online. Phone no is provided but no one answering. Sigh...."
"Beautiful riverfall with Kelah fish playing at your feet. Please wear waterproof bag and shoes since you're going to get wet during cross river session."
"A very good place to visit. Experience the hiking plus clear waterfalls. A lot of fish and it is good place for outdoors activities."
"Very nice and chilling area. The air is fresh, the water is cool and the fish is so friendly. I would recommend to stop and relax on the 2nd or 3rd crossing river. U dont really need to complete all crossings until the 7th last stops. Becoz the last stop with waterfall view is always crowded with people and very difficult to find a quiet spot. Lastly...this area will be closed from 1stOct2020 to 28Feb2021 to allow the fish to continue breeding."
"Relatively easy hike to the waterfall with a few river crossings. Water gets quite deep at the last couple of crossings so be prepared to get wet up to your waist at least. Had a fun time feeding the fishes and getting really close to them. The waterfall at the end is a nice reward for the hike."
"Nice place ... nice inviroment..."
"Absolutely a must visit place for those who love nature and greenery. Easy trail going to the waterfall and you get to see fishes along the way in the river. Dont forget to bring food for them. Worth the journey all the way to the waterfall."
"Decent hike stroll, not too difficult, very clear paths. Cool thing is you get to cross rivers, some mid shin deep, some waist deep. Lots of fish swimming around, not exactly the cleanest of places. The end waterfall was a bit of a let down. It was pretty small, and you can try to jump off rocks near the waterfall base, but do watch out for slippery rocks."
"Hi all, is it safe to park our car outside along the roadside."
"clean,semi extreme activities, lots of fish and tame, prepare yourself before boarding"
"*Updated:Closed  from 1 October 2020 - 28 February 2021. *
At first i thought that it's like most of my hiking experience. But this one is different, I didn't expect to cross so many rivers, not one or two, but arou d 5 river you need to cross untill you found a waterfall. The best part is, the fish that allow you to pet them. It was so amazing and the view are breathtaking. I never regret to go here. I wish i can go after MCO. You need to register first before you go in. And there were many parking lots at the entrance. You need to walk a bit before you can find the real entrance. At there you need to register first. There were restrooms, some stalls and they also sell fish foods. So that you can give to the fish at the waterfall. To cross the river it was so challenging for me. Hahaha because Im not tall, the river flow quite hard and deep. Don't worry many people can help you with it. Just follow the flow. I really recommend this place. Go and enjoy the view of flora and fauna. Especially the fish!"
"GO GET A DIP and enjoy the 'fish spa' experience. Be prepared to get wet as you're expected to do river crossings. Best is go get your rubber shoes on! Easy to track, and the first 2 stages is suitable for children. They sell fish food/pellets at the registration counter. The main attraction is THE waterfall which is after the 6th river crossings. Awesome! COME ON FRIDAY to avoid the weekend crowd.

Only SAD PART is and don't know how long this place will last as there's word going around that #TNB will be building electric tower across the fish sanctuary!"
"Nice place, for first timer make sure bring bbq tools and food, also tent if not sure will regret 😍"
"Came all way far. Were there a week back and it's temporary closed for breeding and conservation of the tengas fishes until 29 February. And it didn't up to date on Google."
"Decided to bring my friend here cuz I had a great time the last trip. But saw this notice instead. For those who are coming, please take note yeah? Will be closed till end of February"
"The best Place to Hiking and enjoy the waterfall at last"
"Worth the 1 hour hike up and the 1 hour hike back. Beautiful waterfall. Easy trek."
"Open at 9am only. Please bring a pen to fill in the entry form."
"Still close without future notice"
"Very nice place to relax your mind. But need to careful, once is raining, run for your life before the water level of the river rise up."
"Clean and cool river with fishes swimming ard"
"Nice view, friendly staffs  and fish (^o^). This place has rules that we need to bring back our rubbish after picnic which is no problem for me. Got place for children to play with fishes with less deeper water. Cold and refreshing water. But there is certain people that try to catch fish illegally and didn't pick their plastic/rubbish after picnic. This place might be closed forever due this irresponsible behaviour."
"fresh air , clean river and full of kelah fish. You have to cross 6 rivers before reaching the waterfall."
"Is closed now. Surrounding unmanaged"
"Unfortunately this was closed when we go there. Better to check and go since they have a closing period."
"Crowded for parking but good for shopping"
"One of the rare waterfall in Malaysia where you have to jungle trek and river cross five times to reach the place."
"Dubbed as one of the most impressive waterfalls in Selangor, it takes about an hour and a half of moderate hiking to get to the waterfall. The route will require you wade across the Chilling river 6 times, with ropes to help you balance without falling in. You will also find schools of fish swimming around the crystal clear river water that you can feed by buying fish food at the entrance."
"Good for kids on the outside and hiking into the waterfall"
"Wonderful waterfall, got space for adult as well as small place for kids and family to swim.
No rest rooms around.
Not suitable for barbeque. It is all about swimming.."
"Located in Kuala Kubu Bahru, which is about an hour’s drive from Kuala Lumpur, Chiling Waterfalls is where most people go for an old-fashioned picnic-by-the-river scene. Loads of hikers can cool off in the river and play in the water after about an hour’s hike up to the scenic waterfall. Tip: bring loads of drinking water and snacks for this one! You’re going to need it when you reach the waterfall (because you realise how hungry you really are)."
"I noticed they are Closed on friday and monday"
"RM1 per entry will be collected by the park rangers at the entrance. Carpark is located right outside the sanctuary (with no touts or anyone collecting a fee which is great). There are toilets as well which are also free. There are in total 6 river crossings which can get pretty deep so if you are bringing your kids please just stick to the 1st pond near the suspension bridge and not venture in too much. We saw families bringing babies crossing the rivers right until the waterfall which is just too risky and dangerous as the rocks can get very slippery and the water chest deep during the rainy season. Trekking terrain was not too difficult as the journey to get to the waterfall is not steep and mostly ground level, aside from having to legover a few huge tree trunks."
"Went there today, great place for hiking and swimming with fishes. According to the caretaker, 27/9/2020 will be the last day this place opens to visitor and it will close down till next year until further notice.

You can call or whatsapp the number in the photo to make sure the place is open before visiting."
"Best tapi crowded"
"Chilling! The water is very cold and clear. The fishes swims very near to you. If you want to go to the main waterfall, prepare to cross several rivers waist high. Toilets are not so clean."
"It's great place for a weekend outing. Good for all ages. Those who can trek for 3KM inside, can see marvelous nature's beauty.  Water is so chilling and need to cross several places through water."
"Great place to visit, the water is pristine and the fish sanctuary is amazing"
"Easy hike to reach the waterfall. Undulating terrain but not steep at all.  Able to swim with Kelah fish. But please do clean after yourself. Saw few  irresponsible people  just leaving their food trash after they finish it. There is a small fee for entering and also they charge for how many food item uou bring up. Just declare and make sure you bring down your trash. You will get back your deposit. I think that it is one way to deter people from littering. Water is really chilling like its name. A note. They have limited and slightly run down toilet facility for you to clean up. So take note and bring a long a big sarong"
"The Fish Sanctuary in Sg Chiling is a must-see destination for locals and tourists alike.
Sg Chilling is a river and as with all river, great caution and care is needed to ensure safety during this excursion. It is advisable to check on the weather before embarking on this journey.
There are actually 4 waterfalls in Sg Chiling but only One is open to the public for safety reasons.
To get to the waterfall, there are 6 River crossings with different depth and difficulty to get across. There is also a big log acting as a bridge to cross the river.
The most interesting  thing to experience during crossing is the vast amount of Kelah Fish swimming freely in the river and around your feet . I bought some fish food at the entrance to feed the Kelah Fish. As it is a sanctuary for Kelah Fish, capturing or fishing is not allowed.
The place is open from Friday to Sunday and is advisable not to go during rainy season. There is a minimal fee imposed for entry. Do bring along an extra pair of clothings to change as getting wet is not an option."
"Are they open on public holiday?"
"Away from city and very close to mother nature. This place is closed during fish breeding season (dec-feb). Alternative hike location is kampung sungai pertak which is probably 5 km away. Forgot to take photo."
"This place is clean. Food here is limited but cheap. Can bring your own food but must pay some refundable deposit."
"Please take out your rubbish together with you when you are out! Please😣. Last visit in 2017 the sanctuary are more beautiful and clean.  Now, visitor keep dumping plastic bottles and stuff. Please stop."

"Good place for beginner trekker, relatively minimal rubbish (going up to waterfall) & family picnic (lower floor/near entrance).. downside, small parking space & lot of trash at the parking spot)"
