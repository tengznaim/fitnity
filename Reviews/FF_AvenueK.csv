"I just went to try Fitness First.
Actually interested in applying for membership.
But the male employee who consults the male member with glasses talks rude. Doesn't respect customers.  üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº

Very bad reception. So I decided not to subscribe here.  So I went to apply for membership elsewhere."
"I'd give it zero stars if I could.

Whilst the staff are nice, the management is absolutely trash. Do not join this gym if you want towel service or steam/sauna. All other gyms have reopened their steam/sauna and started providing towel service since 2021 but the FF group (Fitness First, Celebrity Fitness, Chi X) still haven't done so.

They say it's to ""protect members"" but it's a lie for their cost cutting measure. Their management always tell us it's the government's SOP but they can never provide a government SOP prohibiting them from providing towel service or reopening their spa facilities.

Avoid if you could. Babel is right across in Suria KLCC and Peak Fitness down the road have all reopened their spa facilities and never stopped providing towel service.

I am giving my one month notice after getting lied to for months about this cost cutting measure."
"Feeling cheated with the 14 day cancellation period by the male seller guys called Nasim & the bolded Indian stallone style guy. Thet let me wait till the last hour (!) at day 13, 24 h was over.
Be aware first day of training is already counted as a day.
The following i could witness the guys' rhetoric 'abilities', that must have been taught from a cheap seller-school. Hopefully it was not you, Fitness First, cause rhetoric always gives a deeper glimpse behind the curtain.

Leg curl not working. Pls do repair."
"I visited this gym while on a business trip to KL. Centrally locates, it‚Äôs one of the best gyms I‚Äôve seen. Worked out during lunch time on a Monday but it wasn‚Äôt crowded and no wait times at equipment. Very nicely equipped, it LD great for both cardio, strength training and functional training.

In terms of improvements, they should get at least one more bench press and lat pull down.

Complementary beverages also available (water, tea, coffee and sodas). If I ever end up in KL I‚Äôm definitely taking a membership."
"I bumped into one of your male staff outside a barber shop (nimroc, danau kota) and he was extremely rascist and uttered rascist words as I walked past him, for absolute no reason at all. Your toxic Malay staff should realize that even outside work they should remember that they represent this gym. Absolutely disgusting and low classed behavior."
"Signed up for PT sessions with Naim, very professional, diligent and most importantly he understands the requirements that my body needs in order to achieve my fitness goals üëçüëçüëç"
"Really clean gym, nice staff, within a big mall. I‚Äôll try again ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Just order the chanban! Super good."
"I found the showers to be dirty, the woodwork in the sauna falling apart and what is happening to the supply of towels.?"
"There is a much bigger studio on the lower level after the renovation post MCO. Can't wait to try it out!"
"Except the PT trainer, all services are terrible especially after the pandemic. Finally I had to cancel my membership despite the cancellation fee. I totally DO NOT recommend anyone to this gym. They are friendly only to new members and then continue to ignore customers' requests without any response. I already wasted too much time and money. Please NEVER BE FOOLED!! Even one star is a waste."
"I already cancel the membership last year dec and paid advance one month. But on this year feb 2021, it still active and charged me one month fee for no reason .i feel terrible and upset for staff and the company.keep charge and not helpful and not profesional at all .keep said will check and close your phone only. I will not recomand go to this gym center again."
"Love the environment, the staff and all. It feels like 2nd home to me. I can chill while drinking their local coffee or green tea, chatting with friends before my next class or can even do a bit of work out. I especially love the group class trainings!"
"Best and widest floor of FF so far in KL"
"Awesome staff and great maintenance of equipment üëè . They have classes , sauna steam showers excellent lockers and complimentary toiletries. Good to know that it has partnered with other international gyms so foreigners* can also use it. *- from specific countries only"
"There are variety of yoga classes here. Easy accessible by Public Transport. The fitness center keep upgrading the facilities like hair dryer and locker. They introduce apps for class booking which easier to manage calendar and not crowded during CMCO."
"Best gym ever.  I was a member when I was in Kuala Lumpur. Staff were very friendly and we had many group activities and classes. The instructors, the personal trainers- every single one of them were friendly. I enjoyed working out there a lot. It was like my second home."
"i went her Dec 12th 2019 and it was a great gym, lots of options, great equipment, i was there from 4-6 pm and not too busy....Great staff and a day pass cost me 65RM i think...it was slightly discounted i think from 85RM.....Visiting from the US.....Overall very happy"
"This is an excellent gym. The people are friendly and the instructors are world class. Body Attack was absolutely amazing. Well worth taking the time out to go whilst on our holiday away from London"
"Love this gym. Has all the equipment that I needed for my workout. From the hammer strength-like machines to the olympic lift platforms, to the turf area and squat cages, and many more.  I loved it! Health food eats and a juicer shop were just outside of the gym to the right.

Wish they had packages for short-term travellers. i.e. weekly and monthly passes. Shortest term they had was 6 months, I think."
"SOP not really enforced. They dont check whether only the fully vax mambers could enter."
"Went for one visit. Lady on the front desk was very friendly and cheerful. Equipment is more geared towards cardio and machines Not a real weight training gym. Had a boxing bag which  is a bonus. Only negative experience was, i was there for my leg day. I was waiting for a lady to get off the leg press machine. As she was getting off i went to get on it, and a personal trainer and his client just claimed it as i was getting on it. Thats fine. But he and his female client spent nearly 1/2 hour on it mostly chatting away. I was very annoyed knowing he knew i wanted to use it and he obviously couldn't care less. Chat her up somewhere else. Not in the gym"
"Very large gym, a little crowded after working hours. Lots of classes, drinks and equipment. Works best with the Fitness First App aka Custom Fit. Best to get a passport membership so that you are not stuck in 1 gym location only."
"No towels, no use of steam/sauna facilities even though they still charge you for them."
"We had a few days stopover in KL and got the 3 day free trial pass. We came for cardio, weights and classes. Great place! Free coffee and tea and Gatorade, lots of functional training options, free weight area, cardio machines, tons of classes to choose from. If I lived here I would join for sure."
"I love this gym. The staff are friendly. There are a variety of ages, races and genders. As a plump middle-aged woman I don't feel uncomfortable. Everyone does their own thing and is supportive of each other. I like that."
"Came to this place once, the place is quite good place, really enjoyed the work out while looking the view. The staff are good and friendly. But the parking ticket are too expensive unlike The Curve I only pay rm3 while rm12 here for the same amount of time."
"Pretty average gym and not one I would called Platinum standard. They kept marketing for new members but do not looked after existing members well. I normally go there between 6 to 7pm, after works, getting a carpark space in dark basement floors in Avenue K is like striking a small consolation price. Once in, getting a locker card or locker that works is not an assured thing. I have many times have to walk back to the counter to get another card. Many of the machines' sound system doesn't work well and the TV shows have little variety.Other FF clubs have far more TVs than this one. There is no CNBC for sure. After your cardio, if you try to workout on toning machines or weight, forget about it, too many people, tight spaces and few machines.You try the floor exercises for stretching or core muscles, you have to fight for spaces with the PT and their students. Then you go for your shower, some of the doors doesnt have hooks for months to hang your towel and hopefully God willing the locker door can open......Well, thats my another session of working out at FF Avenue K, if only they have marketed themselves as a 3 stars gym, I won't feel so bad but I am paying RM200+ a month here..."
"I think this is the most profitable (and most crowded!) Fitness First branch in Malaysia due to its location just opposite of the Petronas Twin Towers and within the CBD. In terms of friendliness of the front desk, the staff are not as friendly as the other branches. I also noticed that unlike other FF branches here in Malaysia, most of the members here do not put back the dumbbells to their rightful place and some even just leave it on the floor. Due to this and the friendliness issue, I'm giving this branch not full stars but 4-stars."
"Fitness First Ave K has not made any improvements in its weights area for at least five years. The most obvious shortfalls and improvements that need to be addressed are:
Another bench press required.
A Decline Bench is required (the current practice under the Smith Machine is unsafe).
Dumbbells up to 50kg
More of the dumbbells between 10 and 30 kg
A Lying Leg Curl Machine.
More set barbells.
A second Smith  Machine.
A second Lat Pulldown machine.
It‚Äôs also the only gym I have been to where the squat rack is not facing the mirrors. It will fit if you rotate it 90 degrees, I have measured it.Or get a tradesmen to cut a litte out of the centre and it will definitely fit.
I suspect the only changes though will be to the coffee area......or until a gym opens up in competition to FF."
"Fully equipped  gym with coffee, tea, isotonic  drinks provided
Fantastic shower place.
However it was too crowded.  The squat racks was always occupied."
"The gym equipment are starting to broke & tear down ( maybe lack of maintenance ) and too many members that cannot afford deodorant  but can afford paying the gym fee. The shower water pump also not that strong and always run out of hot water."
"Friendly staff. Great facilities"
"Fitness first platinum outlet which only offer milk in the morning (clarified with the staff) .
When you are paying for platinum price but won't get any platinum benefit (milk supply) in the afternoon/evening. This wasn't the first time, where the milk is not longer supplying in the afternoon or evening."
"I am looking for a gym to join and went in to inquire. Felt like I was judged by your consultant that killing rush hour is not also a valid reason, he asked, ""Why don't you wait at the starbucks?"" He thinks to lose weight or gain muscle is a MORE valid reason. Probably if I said to gain muscle, he could earn more? What a culture he's representing Fitness First. I'm sorry, but this's rude."
"customer friendly and worth of money paid."
"One of the best gym in KL located in one of best mall Ak Avenue.. supber facilities..."
"Good club. Plenty of cardio and weight machines. Free weights area is rather small, which is quite typical for FF clubs. Plenty of nice looking and fit chicks too."
"Gym I go to most week day mornings. Best I've found in the area. Superb group fitness instructors of high standard + pts if you wish."
"Blood Sucker. During freeze period, need to pay40 for nothing. When asked to terminate membership, need to unfreeze and charge one month full fees"
"Ridiculous prices if you want to go for 1 day or even 1 month. One day is $17 whereas one month is almost $150! Never seen such a prices in asia. Besides it is extremely crowded in evening."
"Best Gym in Town with best Trainers"
"Satisfying. Open as early at 6.30am. Have sauna and steam room. Easily accessebile by train (lrt kj line klcc) . Yoga class every morning at 7am."
"Best gym ever. My favourite gym. Friendly staff and very flexible group workouts. Lot of options to choose."
"Been awhile, its sad that many shops are closed due to covid. Hopefully we'll be able to recover"
"Too crowded especially after working hours. Most of the time you might not even get a spot to do your abs workout. Bad."
"Nice and clean. Alot of hot women too. üòÅ"
"A real gym for high end gym in town of KL. Real place but busy during evening frim 6 to 9 pm. Nice and convinient gym to go"
"Super clean, good equipments, friendly staff and premium style gym"
"Unfortunately I can't rate this zero stars. Stay as far away as you can from this place as possible. Horrible isn't a bad enough adjective to describe their staff and attitude. The abosolute rock bottom of human behaviour."

"(Translated by Google) As a tourist, I didn't want to completely pause my usual program. I was there on Sunday from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and cannot fault the equipment or the changing room.

- Water and lemon are included
- 2 towels (small for training +
Towel)
- Dumbbells up to 40 KG

Price for the day ticket was that for me
Day 47 Myr.

"(Translated by Google) I like FF AK the most. There are Bodyjam & Zumba classes. Best and most fun Teachers are very good. I like the most Uchop. Dance the most. From people who can't dance at all Now we dance at the right time and more importantly, we reduce to 20 kg. Within 8 months, all the staff are nice, nice, nice atmosphere, can see the twin towers and Suria beautiful. Have a klcc train station, convenient transportation, most importantly, the price is not expensive membership
