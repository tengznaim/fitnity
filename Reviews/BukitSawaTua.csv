"With short hike about 30-40 minutes from Kampung Peradong, you can have a unique view here with red bark tree like the Red Forest Jerantut, two different peak with 360° and another 180° view with rocks like Bukit Batu Chondong.

This place require permit to enter, you should get permit first from Pejabat Perhutanan Negeri at cost RM5 per person. You will get through village path, rubber plantation and covered trail to the peak. It is easy and suitable for children too.

If you are coming here to catch the fog, you have to make it early as the fog quickly dissipates after 10 am. Best chance if after a heavy downpour the day before!
And if you are coming here in the early hours, do bring a headlamp. The trail is dark and although in the secondary forest, it is riddled with roots and tree stubs."
"Fairly easy and short hike, buy lovely view of red forest and the peak"
"Full of spider webs but a fairly easy hike. Best hike after a heavy rain for more cloud."

"What a great place to hike with your family and friends...."

"Took 1.5 hours drive from Kuala Lumpur.
It is an easy, beginner friendly hike to see cloud and very windy at the hilltop!

30-40 minutes to reach the top!
Just follow the sign board or the path which is noticeable.

Parking is RM3 per car.
Toilet is available, RM0.50 per entry.
Permit is needed, RM5 per person. Apply permit online at Jabatan Perhutanan Negeri Sembilan, you can also pay the permit on the spot at the entrance but it is just temporary.
