"With short hike about 30-40 minutes from Kampung Peradong, you can have a unique view here with red bark tree like the Red Forest Jerantut, two different peak with 360° and another 180° view with rocks like Bukit Batu Chondong.

This place require permit to enter, you should get permit first from Pejabat Perhutanan Negeri at cost RM5 per person. You will get through village path, rubber plantation and covered trail to the peak. It is easy and suitable for children too.

If you are coming here to catch the fog, you have to make it early as the fog quickly dissipates after 10 am. Best chance if after a heavy downpour the day before!
And if you are coming here in the early hours, do bring a headlamp. The trail is dark and although in the secondary forest, it is riddled with roots and tree stubs."
"Fairly easy and short hike, buy lovely view of red forest and the peak"
Full of spider webs but a fairly easy hike. Best hike after a heavy rain for more cloud.
"Trail:
Moderate, some parts are very steep. Get a good grip shoes otherwise  when u go down will slipped.

Tips: Get a hiking poles to assist your climb. Less tham rm50 at Decathlon"
A wonderful experience that you shall not miss. Awarded with nice view at hill top. Red forest is unique at the top.
"Beautiful small hill at Jelebu with wide angle of scenery view. Just a short hike within one hour for 2 way, worth to pay a visit if you are around."
Easy trail and very panoramic views.
"Two private parking spots available. 1 before the trailhead and another just after the trailhead.
Parking RM3 per car. …"
"Nice and easy for hiking, recommended if you wanna see sunrise from a hilltop"
Good hiking trail for beginners.. nevertheless the view was picturesque..
"Have the whole place to ourself when we hiked on late evening. Got a clear view of all the hills at the background. Last 150 m is steep and slippery due to the sandy path, but there are ropes along the way. bring mosquito repellent as you might need it when crossing the rubber plantation."
What a great place to hike with your family and friends....
Good hiking trail for beginners. Easy most of the way and a short steep climb just before reaching the peak. The view at the top is simply awesome and very rewarding. Crowded during weekends just like any other good hiking trails.
Nice view. A bit challenging to the top. But worth it!
Hiking is easy to moderate. Rating 6.2 (A). This is good hiking for beginners and less experienced. Peak is around 333m.  Within 30 mins you can reach the peak.  View is very good. And got shadow of trees and rocks to take nice photos.
Nice view. Especially for the AWAN KARPET
4th times still can't see the cloud
Best Place ..Peace and Fresh air....
very nice view
Good for hiking exercise.
333.33 meters only.. but make us breathless.. bukan landai wei.. ala2 cucu gunung Dato.. so prepare ur mind if u never hiking before especially if u took 2 hill package.. Bukit Beras + Bukit Batu Sawa.

"Took 1.5 hours drive from Kuala Lumpur.
It is an easy, beginner friendly hike to see cloud and very windy at the hilltop!

30-40 minutes to reach the top!
Just follow the sign board or the path which is noticeable.

Parking is RM3 per car.
Toilet is available, RM0.50 per entry.
Permit is needed, RM5 per person. Apply permit online at Jabatan Perhutanan Negeri Sembilan, you can also pay the permit on the spot at the entrance but it is just temporary.

View memang lawa. Kena cuaca cantik pulak. Memang cun. Trek biasa je. Dalam 30 minit boleh sampai
Fuhh. Best hiking place ever. Boleh ajak kengkawan ramai ramai pasal track dia tak berapa adventure sangat. Nak rasa santai² tapi penat boleh lah pergi kat sini.
Beautiful view with the carpet clouds .. easy to climb .. …
"Interesting place, easy, suitable for children ²"
"If you see a carpet cloud, you have to go up at 6.30 in the morning .."
"The 45-minute climb and down 30 minutes, the right time if the rain on the previous day was up at 7.30am. Carpet clouds are usually around 8.30 am - 10 am"
