The campus is kinda outside city and it has every facility that a student would need, even more. From golf course to horse riding. The quality of education is so good and I learned so much in very short span of time. And the school has a huge Library, probably the biggest in Malaysia. They have panoramic tour on their website, check it out, it's just great. You will fall in love for sure."
