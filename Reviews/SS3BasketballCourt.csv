Good court but when it rains lots of splash from the outside makes it slippery
The court was quite easy to access. But the maintenance is the worst. The rooftop was horribly damaged and the rims was bend forward maybe due to people dunking.
Nice court to play if it rained. Rims should be up for maintenance soon.
"Almost always occupied in the weekends morning.  Can park around the court. Got roof but sometimes if there was storm the night before, then floor would be wet as heck. There would be puddles. Often found one side of the court to be missing hoop."
"The Place is quite accessible. Spacious for doing any sports. On Sunday wherein Arnis Malaysia do it its Arnis training, it is quite enough for number of people (10-12) while other groups practice basketball.

Lights off after 10. Quite a safe and clean place sports gathering / practice."
Basketball Court's condition getting worse. Roof's leaking from few places when raining. More holes in the basketball court. Paint's fading. MBPJ did major renovation for hall (badminton courts) but nothing to the basketball court despite being a regular rental for all these yearsðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
"Covered basketball court in SS3.
Used intensively by many people. In the morning, different exercise groups that practice tai chi, dance classes and later in the day the younger people come to play their basketball games."
"The basketball court are always maintained in good shape and it's very clean, hardly will see any rubbish in this area."
Its shaded but that is about it. Surounded by houses so its not too quiet. Overall good vibes.
Court is in disrepair. At night the lights sometimes won't even be turned on. Dirty surroundings and shady people around.
Nice tennis courts
"On lucky days, you'll find a court ready to use but on any usual day, be prepared to find no hoops to play basketball."
It's a closed court so it would not matter at what time your playing basketball...plus you can exercise by playing basketball whenever you want to
"Rental is cheaper.  Very well utilized for Seniors Excercise program, Line Dancing, Basketball Tournaments, etc"
"The court looks ok, but i didnt see anyone playing there."
It's a decent experience to play basketball ball there but there are alot of mosquitoes

"There are few people, itâ€™s best to practice on your own. If you donâ€™t open it at night, you should book it. Occasionally being occupied by others to practice Tai Chi. One of the baskets was broken and crooked for a long time, and no one repaired it."

Court okay but for now the ring is broken
Big but unfortunately if there is a parking event it is difficult.
