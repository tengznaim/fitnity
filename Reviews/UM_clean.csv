The campus is full of greenery and beautiful building.
Its good to have a jog in the campus."
1,The oldest and highest ranking Malaysian institution‚ù§Ô∏è Second home since 2007-present
2,"Top university in Malaysia, it's good to study here. The cafes and foods are very nice especially the Faculty of Science roti canai. Have quite some good places to relieve stress and near to most malls around KL."
3,"Malaysia's oldest university. Obviously it'll look stunning on the outside but the problem lies in the lack of parking spots provided for students and visitors. Most, (not many), of the parking spots that are visible are for the staff and personnel so if you wanna come here, sure, but it depends on your luck on that day. Anyway, UM has an eye pleasing surrounding and definitely ig-worthy. Oh, and, mind you, this uni is HUGE so you may get lost."
4,"University Malaya is located at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It's 10 minutes away from Pasar Seni.
Every year I come to this University to send my students for an International Scrabble Tournament.
All the students are professional and outstanding. They are not only from Malaysia, but also from different countries like Indonesia and Singapore.

There are also some canteens inside the campus and the price is affordable for students. There are Nasi lemak, nasi goreng and many more. If you are walking to residental college, they provide water refill and there is also vending machine. It's really helpful for students."
5,It's been 5 years since  my son's graduation of Masters ..Thank you üôè UM for the memorable ceremony..

26,Nice and green Campus. the area is so big that you definitely need a car to roam around the campus. Public transport inside the campus is really helpful to connect with LRT & MRT services.
27,New building block. Clean and spacious. Over charged car parking fees for a semi public hospital. Difficult to maneuver in car park due to narrow driveway. Old building under refurbishment.
28,"Having a very good time here at UM with the rest of Komatra Sajian team (KK12). Im glad there are ducks at kk12, cute chubby cats around. The best thing, there is tree hut and maze, reban itik angsa, lake and the overall surrounding. ‚Ä¶"

And don't believe that Mark Zuckerberg and others can be successful if they stop studying. OH! He dropped out of one of the best universities in the ""WORLD"" instead of SPM!"
