"Only 1 court to share. Pi main tempat lain lah org lain hahahahhaa. Small park also but nice for people who lives here."
"A small residential park which is quite adequate for the local neighborhood. Good climbing frames and swings for the kids - usually in a good state of repair. Short exercise track, benches and off-road parking. Very occasionally there may be a curious monkey venturing out from the surrounding trees."
"It is a good and clean Basketball üèÄ court which has been refurbished since its last condition. There are flood lights as well so those who want to play before the park closes at 10pm can do so."
"Went 3pm-4.30pm and mostly shady. Nice playpark and swings. Wear mosquito spray!"
"One of the only green spaces nearby. Limited, but considering the lack of park space in Taman Sa, it's a nice escape and pretty quiet most of the time."
"Court floor slightly uneven and some parts slippery (moss?). But it's free and the crowd is friendly."
"Quite a big park with a basketball court. But it is a bit dark and scary at night as the only light comes from the basket ball court."
"Secluded place with green trees making it really calm place to play"
"Good place for the young and old."
