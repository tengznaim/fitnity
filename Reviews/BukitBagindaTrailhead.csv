"Great hiking experience! Difficulty is moderate, only 450m but the trail is all the way up. Not much flat surface, when going down hill will feel quite steep. Have to pay more attention during the rainy days, going down will be very slippery. Other than the wave rock, must visit the cave before going up. Btw, there were some monkeys roaming around near the trailhead."
If it is near; i'll go everyday. Less than 4km to the peak of 450m. Friendly steep climb; clear small trail.
It took only abt 1.5hrs to the summit. Easy climb and suitable for beginners. Every check points was was short. total 8 checkpoints (I think). No views at the summit but its a good training ground.
"Steep hike but doable for beginners. A total of 8 Check Point (CP) to the peak. Most area are with ropes to assist, but proper shoes with good grip is advised as some place can be slippery when rain or dry (loose soil/sand). No view at the peak but the 'Wave Rock' is the main attraction. Parking can be a challenge due to its location especially during weekends, so do come early."
A good place to hiking. Total 8 CP to the top. Some place is steep but there is rope to assist.
trailhead till half way saw red notice board still under private area
Just follow Google location to the trailhead. The landowner will collect RM3 from each hiker. The permit of RM5 will be collected by Jabatan Perhutanan officers who usually come between 9 to 2 for duty. The trail is considered easy. First km is almost flat then u will reach CP1. Total 8 checkpoints and about 200m apart.
"Good and quite a workout, the famous waves rocks worth all the effort!!!"
I love its elevating track. Steep and challenge your endurance either on your way up or down. There's no view but just a huge wave megaliths rock.
"Less people and good hiking trail.
Only there is rubbish at trail head.

Pay RM8 for entry"
Easy to park...the road in and out can be different way so you don't have to be afraid of incoming cars as the road is only a single lane width.
Very good

"Not difficult but enjoyable and a hill with beautiful woods (450M)
Selling points: caves, large stone scenic spots, black and white large rocks, wave large rocks"
Best trail. That part rm8 pay is not the best. Apekemahal nau üòë
First time coming here. Unexpectedly through a large brick tunnel all the way to Baginda hill. At the top of the hill there is a Stone Grasp symbolic of the place. It takes about an hour to get there
Yea it's the best

Mediocre
