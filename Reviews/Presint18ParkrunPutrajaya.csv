"A friendly and pretty parkrun with a flat out and back course. Definitely worth a visit for a parkrun tourist and locals should join in each week. Runners, joggers, walkers and everything in between all welcome."
"Spend your Saturday morning  by joining this  5km  running event and it's free to participate. Bring along your family and make new friends .A big applause to the organizer and volunteers that always support and cheer up the runner along the route. The best part is ,you can track your timing results  at their websiteðŸ˜Ž"
