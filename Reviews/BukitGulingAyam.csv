"this direction will not lead you to Bukit Guling Ayam trailhead!!!  We got lost! We went through a blog and found the coordinates and reached this place 15 minutes later, phew! You better navigate to Petronas Lingkaran Karak. You will come across Shell Station prior to reaching this Petronas station. you may find a parking here if you are early and fortunate.  the trailhead is the ecopark signboard (private land)  next to the Petronas station but they allow access. easy but rocky hike with a splendid view. along the way you may witness grape vineyard, fig trees and passion fruit (all in progress). i went there on 30/10/2021). If you do not possess your own transport, you may take LRT until Gombak Station and take a GRAB or Cab to Lingkaran Karak Petronas. it's roungly 12 minutes from the LRT Gombak. the fare probably RM12-RM15."
"Easy shortest hike for all, say about 15-20mins. Awesome view at the peak with the surroundings of Gombak and KL city views.
The location is the Petronas MRR2 attached with Starbucks, you can park there. Best for sunrise and sunset view 🙏🏽👍🏽👌🏽"
Easy trail. Suitable for all type of hikers.
"Short track, easy access, no need take long time to get the beautiful scenery"
"Easy trail for beginners.

1) parking- Free (at Pertonas MRR2)
2) enterance fee - Free
3) toilets - can use Petronas toilets
4) hiking - takes 8 min only to reach peak
5) children - can brings kids. Just be careful near the peak"
Nice relaxing trial and hike. Go early for spectacular sunrise views
"Easy and shortest uphill hike within 15min. Can see surrounding Gombak city views. Please use gps, Urban Ecolife Agrofarm as starting point. Originally shared gps totally wrong and inaccurate. 🙏"
"Easiest hiking trail to summit for beginners. Only took 15 minutes depends on the trail condition. I went up after 2 days non stop raining, luckily I did wear a proper hiking shoes. The trail could turn out to be slippery so do prepare with a suitable gear."
Incorrect location. Please search Petronas Lingkaran Karak instead
The trail is quite nice. Need 20 minutes to reach the top.
Good
It's not right direction. Everybody Please Report for the right location
Suitable for newbie hikers.
Awesome 360 view of Kuala Lumpur City Centre surrounding area including Gombak area. It just take 10-15 minute to reach peak from Petronas (petrol station). This petrol station is located at MRR2 before kata highway exit.
Awesome 360 view 😁😁
View 360. Want to go up on private land. Be smart and chat with the owner of the area. Do not disturb the area or their crops. It's okay to work up a sweat. One way in 10-15 minutes. Parking also has to be good to find. Riding a fun photo
"You can park at Petronas Lingkaran Karak. Parking is very limited. Started climbing up to the top. The total round trip distance is less than 1km. When going up, you can bring gloves. The stone is quite sharp and be careful if it rained the night before. The shortest hiking trail. After hiking, I had rice kerabu at the stall next to Starbucks. delicious..."
