"Amazing futsal court, great condition and facilities . Parking would be hard during peak hours , so come early . The court is well lit too."
"Great customer service and awesome admins as well.
Would recommend people to come here.
Great place to play some futsal, volleyball, hockey, captain ball, dodgeball and frisbee."
"Amazing futsal courts, excellent staff. But don't count on having your slots held for you. Had our block booking revoked after having kept a deposit down throughout the entire lockdown. Was kicked out when they decided to rent the place out for volleyball instead. Long live the Republic of Volleyball."
"Was a great place to play and very clean courts and price was cheap"
"After being their regular customer for over 5yrs playing futsal every weekend they cancelled all sessions to accomodate for VOLLEYBALL. VOLLEYBALL on futsal court...which means they do not care as long you have $. Going elsewhere with my pals. You dont get rewarded for loyalty."
"Its a very nice place to play futsal...very good environment...the staff there is very friendly...highly recommended for futsal"
"Courts are good but parking is extremely difficult during peak hours/at night. There are 2 separate entrances for the badminton courts and the futsal courts with the badminton courts facing the back and the futsal one nearer the makan stalls."
"Very very good place and kind staft"
"The courts are super spacious with very friendly staffs"
"Cool place, they've got a nearest food court"
"good futsal pitch.. they have 4 standard pitch & 1 FIFA court.. the enviroment is clean & tidy.. toilet also clean.. there also have JOMA shop in the futsal centre."
"Pretty expensive for the FIFA sized court but worth the money! Very well maintained facility!"
"Got 2 different Futsal court sizes. Bench for supporters."
"Reasonable court price around PJ area.. Bigger/Vast parking lot compared with other courts around.. Friendly staff..make sure be early atleast 30 to get parking.."
"The futsal courts are still new. Price is reasonable. The surroundings are well maintained and kept clean. Lots of parking."
"Very big place, their FIFA court is super clean and nice.

Overall I would say their price is reasonable for such nice environment and convenient parking. Don't forget that they also have both Chinese and Malay foodcourt for some carbs loading after the game. Very convenient for me"
"Clean, bright, well equipped with heaters in the toilets. Ample parking space. Nice food stalls right outside to have a meal or a drink after a nice shower after sports. Overall experience 5 stars."
"Relatively new place. I spend my Sat evening playing badminton at this place. Rubber courts and the lighting is not too glaring for me. Since it is still new, facilities are still clean and proper. Recently they have implemented a RM1 per entry parking, but plenty of parking spaces. You should check it out for your badminton or futsal session."
"Nice staff, nice court, they also have cafe outside if you're tired and thirsty after you play. Very nice place to play futsal"
"Have big parking area, need pay rm1 per entry, have gym and futsal court. Can bring family together to dinner here while the rest play games or gym. Very convenient for oku also. Clean toilet."
"Excellent and Perfect place"
"Nice place for futsal and badminton but limited parking space, and please clean the surau"
"Highly recommended. New place, very comfortable and price is very reasonable.
Toilets are clean, have surau for Muslims to pray. There's futsal league for men & women category. There's also nearby gym, food restaurant and badminton court."
"Clean courts and well ventilated. Parking has started to become an issue lately as there are more establishments around."
"Best place ever to play futsal"
"This place is quite new. There's a gym and a a place to eat nearby. I think the parking space is more than adequate to cater for all the visitors at any point in time. There are a total of 4 regular size futsal courts with rubber tiles and 1 fifa court;also made of  rubber tiles. Everything is clean and the toilets also feel clean. The only downside for me is the prayer room, it's is a bit too small to cater for even 1 futsal team group prayer. If your game is in between two prayer periods, and your team does not have any subs, this would really inconvenient as pause for prayer would take much longer than if the room is a bit bigger."
"Best place for Futsal & Volleyball games"
"One of the best futsal courts in PJ! Their pricing is really decent as well for the quality and experience. Floor is well maintain and not slippery."
"Clean toilet and there’s a prayer room, got some restaurants around so it’s pretty convenient. Ample parking space."
