"After 6 months termination of Fitness First Membership, suddenly in 1 July 2022 received bank notification regarding credit card was charged monthly fees.

After Fitness First investigation and was a mistake due to their staff reactivated wrongly my membership which I never ever requested.

For them to refund back to my credit card need to take 6-8 weeks time. Since they admitted mistake, when come to refund needed to take longer time according to their policy.

I have spoken to the Team Leader Operations (The Curve) within 5 days if the refund does not credit back to my credit card and I will follow up with a police report on this issue.

Lesson learned, once you had terminated your fitness first membership, please contact your bank to replace a new card with new number.

"Bad management! I‚Äôve cancelled my memebership in May and agreed to be charged for the month of June. Yet someone extended my membership and charged me for July! The team leader is so slow. Simply charging people‚Äôs card! I had reported on this and yet they responded with ‚Äúwe need to investigate who went and extended your membership, we can‚Äôt assure you that you‚Äôll get your money back‚Äù."
"Worst FF in Malaysia. Do not be deceived by the supposedly ‚ÄúPLATINUM‚Äù Tier gym.

Equipment:
1) Most cardio machine are not usable. There is only 1 stationary bike useable for the whole gym. Atleast 6 treadmill are broken and not repaired since jan 2022.

2) Some weight machines need lubrication but not attended to. Some rusted away.

Locker room:
1) Some lockers are broken and the hinges has fallen off. No attempt to repair by the management since jan 2022
2)  Ceilings in the bathrooms and the locker rooms are moldy. There are bugs infesting in the bathrooms.

3) Frequent sauna breakdown ( operational on june 2022)

Refreshment area:
1) No fruit tea in this platinum gym compared to other gym.

Front desk:
1) Rude staff. They purposely turn off the lights in the locker room to chase their customers away knowingly there are people in the locker room. Imagine dressing and packing your stuff in complete darkness. Is this how a premium gym treat their customers?

Please improve your gym. I would advise potential customers to visit Avenue K FF first before joining here. You will see how deplorable FF the curve is."
"Dropped by to enquire about their latest offerings I came across on IG. The sales associate didn‚Äôt even bother to explain much, gave me short yes or no answers. I needed to initiate the questions instead. And her attn is wandering around like she can‚Äôt wait to be done with me so she can go have dinner or sth. Maybe dah hit quota so she‚Äôs not bothered? And i thought its standard to also offer to have a look around the club and facilities? But wasn‚Äôt even offered the opportunity. So it‚Äôs an instant and definite ‚Äúno‚Äù to this club for me."
"The place are quite good. I always come to this place because the parking is cheap. The steam room is not that hot if compare to Subang empire."
"I.love my FF club at Curve.enjoy the venue environtment and the free coffee and other beverages. Thanks to the management."
"Nicelu located FF in the Curve. couldn‚Äôt get a better location for a fitness üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ"
"It's a good gym with better facilities than staff. The equipment and facilities are great and up to date. There are some equipment that is out of order but it's minimal. Fees are okay especially for the longer duration packages. The staff are generally fine but some important information was withheld from us when me and my partner signed up which led to some embarrassing situations and wasted time."
"Gym is spacious and clean, but most importantly is the cheerful and helpful staff who jokes around and it's so fun having conversation with them.

Equipments are well maintained, and the GX is spacious and mats are properly cleaned and odourless. Changing room is a little bit like a maze but it's well maintained and clean.

Anyway it's a 5 stars experience working out at FF the curve!"
"Spacious lounge area"
"Nice, clean environment. Pleasure to be able to work out in peace and enjoy the Steam afterwhich. Equipment here is well maintained. Shower area could be cleaner though and the staff could be friendlier. Overall nice place to work out."
"By far the most spacious FF club I've ever been in Klang Valley, especially in the age of Covid-19 pandemic, space is king. Also, despite it's been here for more than 15 years, it's still pretty well maintained, I would say comparable to some newer club."
"Gym with great potential and lots of room for improvement.  Many members lack etiquette and leave the weights in the machines for the next person to take out, occupy 2+ machines at the same time, often reading the FB and so on. The management should include an induction course for new members and enforce basic rules. Other than that the management emphasises cosmetic changes instead of addressing important issues of maintenance: most machines have one or another little problem for a long time; for example, batteries were not changed in the rowing machines for over one month; the sauna and steam room have no lights and many times are not available. Etc."
"Friendly staff, great range of beverages (local coffee, infused water flavours, etc.), spacious two storey gym with lounge areas and even two desks for patrons that need to do abit of laptop work. The teachers are all fun and motivating. Nice range of workout activities from Pilates, yoga, dancing workouts, weights, cycling, etc. The members feel like a community which is also nice :) only thing is I‚Äôve seen cockroaches in the bathroom and workout studio more than one occasion and I‚Äôm phobic over them."
"The biggest fitness first in Malaysia ! Classes are superb, equipment , drinks and facilities are well maintained. But that's not the reason why this gym gets five stars, it's the staff and people that work there that makes this place so special. The front service staff are very engaging and personable, Mustafa always engages everyone before and after the session. The trainers are also super commited, it's not a surprise so many repeated clients go back, I've been with saiful for half a year and not only has he helped me recover from my injury with tremendous pace and flexibility but he helped me transform my body beyond my expectations. It's the people and the team that makes this gym special and feel so community oriented , you will fall in love with this place just like I do"
"Pros
Perfect location, great facilities.

Cons
Sound system in yoga room need to be fixed. No fun relaxing during yoga thwn BANG!! the speaker pops over and over

Fragrance of shampoo in showers makes me nauseous but thats my take"
"Worst FF branch . Go learn from avenue k . Tonnes of your equipments are being restricted from being used and you are expecting members to queue for their equipments duting peak hours? By far the worst branch ever . Limited choices of equipment and poor management"
"One of my favourite outlet. Conveniently connected to the CUrve, IPC, ECurve, Ikea and Mutiara Damansara MRT station, it is also right next to the main road where Grab drivers can drop or pick you up straight. Very well equiped and maintained. Can be crowded durimg peak hours but otherwise crowds are quite balancely interspersed ."
"Weights area machine super dusty and dirty and old"
"Nice hospitality great deals while they try to recover from covid lockdown"
"Nice club to do some workouts. Not so crowded these days. I think, Front of House could be more friendly. :)"
