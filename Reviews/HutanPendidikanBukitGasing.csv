reviews
"Best place for hiking, however for those are driving is recommended due to parking issue. You know many people love park car as nearest as possible. This recommended for moderate hikers. But if you new to here just take your time as you need it, once you completed well done. Plan for next week then you will use to it. Estimated to simple loop will take not less than 1hr plus. Best timing to hike at early as 7am not many people so yeah! You can enjoy. Please done come later than 9 or 10 is super hot and many people."
"This was my first time hiking and it's a good trail for beginners. Some parts of the trail has steps that can be steep. There are attractions such as bridges and a little park. There are maps around too but it can be quite hard to follow especially as a person who is not used to using maps, so we asked hikers along the way to go to places and on our way back to the entrance. They were very friendly and helpful. It can be quite easy to get lost. Still overall a nice trail and a good hiking spot for beginners."
"This is my favorite hiking trails in the city.
There are 2 main entrance to this forest reserved, one is PJ side, another one is Kerinchi (KL) side.

There are many split trails along the journey, better download some navigation apps before begin your hikes, to avoid any lost directions which always happens here by newbie visitors.

Both entrance provide spacious free car park and clean toilet facilities."
"Nice place for a hike.

It’s not a challenging hike. There are some check point/chairs for resting.

One of the most Instagramable spot probably is the suspension bridge.

There is some signboard but I hope there is more signboards to show the way.

Reminder : Do not park your car over the yellow lines at road side. I saw some car getting saman."
"Great place hidden in the city centre for a nice hike. The hiking here was relatively easy, at least for some beginners. Its really easy to get food around after the hike as well!"
"We parked at the parking area provided. Come early if you don’t want to end up parking at the side road. There’s also toilet provided. It’s only a 3 min walk to the entrance. We took the longest trail and went to almost all main point. It’s quite difficult, scary as we past cemetary but it was fun. You might end up getting lost but if you follow the AllTrails or Komoot app you should be fine."
"A good place to hike to build muscles.

It is crowded during weekends. At some stretches one have to go slow such as steep slopes and crossing the suspension bridge. Come at weekdays if you can.

Some stretches are steep so hiking poles definitely help. Most of the route aren't paved so can be slippery during or after heavy rain.

Yoy don't hike for view - there is none! More for recreation / exercise.

The foliage is quite dense so most of the time one hike in the shades. It is humid though.

The paths are not clearly marked at the many junctions. Ask fellow hikers or just follow the crowd to reach the suspension bridge.

There is no facilities such as benches and hardly any open space."
"Great trail, lots of ups and downs, trails are clean and well maintained. The forest is still pristine, lots of flora diversity, in terms of wildlife only saw macaques. The streams running through seem quite clean and healthy"
Best place for beginner to hike..but may be busy with alot of people during weekends. Its seem this is the most popular hiking place in Klang Valley.
"This place is popular! We arrived as early as 8am and there were already people who had finished their sunrise hike, casually strolling home. It rained last night and things were a little bit slippery this morning. Plus LOADS of people on the main trail on the PJ side of the park. Thankfully you can escape towards the KL side which is a bit quieter (oh the irony!)."
"Challenging

Between the border of PJ & KL,
amazing outdoor activity for weekend, a bit toughful for high age.

Nature reserve with a popular network of forest trails & a suspension bridge, plus wild monkeys.
Fresh air and branches creaking, feet shuffling through detritus, squirrels chattering, leaves rustling, wind whistling around trunks/disturbing the leaves, birds singing, insects humming/ churring or the rustle of animals.

Highly recommended wearing jungle hiking shoe or equivalent.
bring along with extra cloth and water.

Go before 6:30am to parking, if late than that, need to park at road side (some one said park at yellow line will kena 'saman'.)

Duration about 2 hour,
washroom available at the entrance parking.

Free parking and free entry.

E n j o y
your trip"
"A great spot to hike for beginner. As a beginner you will be mentally challenged with the stairs but it has lots of easy routes as well. There are many people going up on the weekend so you can ask them which route to choose to reach the peak, suspension bridge, or the steel bridge."
"Good hiking spots for beginners like me, hikers are friendly and polite, the neighbourhood feels very safe. Would recommend!!"
"Suitable for family hiking,training,camping and recreation.Easy trail with many entrance and good environment.Bukit Gasing also have many spot to take photo and good facility."
Good place for hiking! Recommended for beginner. It has proper trail. Nice view. Have several trail track can be explored too.
I enjoyed my 1st time at this place.. got many trails in this place..you can ask people around you to guide your way...
"Nice hidden nature gem in the middle of the city. You can be out of the bustle of the city for a bit. Can do long and adventurous trails or easy and laidback trails, both will not disappoint. Bring water if you go for longer walks, not much wind to cool down in the middle of the jungle. Will come back to check the view of the towers!"
A beautiful place to connect with nature within city limits. Another reason for you to love living in KL/Selangor.
Not suitable for beginner hiker. Muddying & lot of mosquitoes. Recommend wearing long sleeve & long pants.
"Bukit Gasing, also known as Hutan Pendidikan Bukit Gasing, is a hill and a green oasis surround at the border between Petaling Jaya (PJ) and Kuala Lumpur (KL). It is popular by local residents for trekking on the weekends.
Hikers and nature lovers should visit here."
I love this nature getaway. Just wished ALL hikers can keep their voices down and enjoy the nature. This is not kopitiam to have chitchat.
"Love this hiking port. Having 2 bridge with a steep stairs. Previously having no sign, nowadays, ppl put some sign along the road. Have 3 entrance as far as i know. PJ, kerinchi(residential area) & tmn rimba bkt kerinchi"
Great hiking spot in PJ@KL@Selangor. Good for family hiking trip
Great place for recreation and trail / hiking trainning. Multiple routes so that you can try different path
1st time hiking at here.. Not bad... More landai2...ad bbrp tmpt yg mnarik tuk berehat santai2 n bgmbr..so far overall not bad la...
"It's a great place for a hike. However during the weekend, the place can get quite crowded at time. Need to be patience. Mosquitoes is quite big and can be very persistent, recommend to bring repellent.
Not recommend if not familiar, route sign is not clear. But can always ask around the visitor for direction."
"Beautiful hutan forest walk in PJ gasing, with many different routes in nature. Enjoyed the walk to reconnect back to myself :)"
Quite long time not doing real hiking when c19 and stayed in uk. And this was my first time going back hiking that was up and down with some slippery mud road. I did extended trek so that some path blocked and some path overgrowth but quite interesting. Love it
Nice hiking place with many exciting trails
"keep fit and jump high!
#selfmotivation #positivevibes #stayhealthy #weekend"
Surprisingly large hiking area. Well maintained amd very suitable for beginners. Trails inside can be very confusing so I recommend using Maps.me to get around. Very pleasant experience.
"For someone who hikes infrequently, this would perhaps be a good one to visit. Trails aren't too difficult though some spots may be a bit treacherous, especially when it's wet. There aren't good scenic lookouts so if you're expecting one, you'd be disappointed. What we like is it's close proximity to the city so it's easily accessible. Since it is quite popular during the weekend, you may want to come early. There is no parking anywhere (or at least what we know of that's legal) so most hikers park their vehicles (at their own risks) by the roadside on residential streets."
Good pace for family hiking..
The trail difficulty is beginner to intermediate. Many loops to choose from. The shortest would be an hour. Full loop is three hours. Suitable for solo hike durig weekend since they'd be many regular hikers. Avoid solo during weekdays it can be very quiet. I enjoy gasing crowd they're super chill and friendly. My go to weekend hike trip.
"Perfect place for nature lovers. I grew up here in the 80s as my school was near. Back then, this place was raw and much nicer that what is is today. Very man made and I guess very commercial. Gets really crowded on weekends and public holidays. Parking is available outside the main entrance. Best to go early in the mornings."
"Good experience to be here. But a bit confusing for the trail. You might be lost in the middle of the forest. Even asked direction to people we seen, but still not get the right direction. Keep asking whenever you see people inside. That's the best solution for direction. :)"
A beautiful hill top to enjoy the view of rapidly developing Kuala Lumpur. Pro tip: bring your own water bottle as there is not much shops up there and don't forget your shades and sun screen because it gets pretty hot in the afternoon despite the breeze
"Bukit Gasing located in PJ. The entrance inside residence area. Please come earlier to get parking here. BTW there is no designated parking for visitors. You need to park at the road side. If come late it will be difficult to find parking.

Track: The track got many junction you need to come with your friends who already experience here or you can mingle around with anyone and ask them.

The track not so tough for me. I can see old people and kids hike together so it just nice track.

Coverage: Since Bukit Gasing is in middle of city you don't have to worry about telco coverage. If you lost you can always google map. 😆

Overall experience 4/5"
"A nice nature exploration site. Bukit Gasing a nice place for beginner to start and enjoy hiking. Locate between PJ and KL, it is easily accessible and ample parking at both the PJ and KL entrance. There is multiple trails within Gasing Hill but don’t worry about getting lost as there is multiple signage and friendly experience hiker that will guide you to the right trail. Worst case, use your phone as there is signal at most of the area in the Hill. Enjoy."
"Came here for the very first time today for hiking. I’d say that it is quite strenuous for beginner hikers. Lots of climbing up and down. There are makeshift steps but some have crumbled due to erosions. Didn’t see any garbage so it was really amazing. Parking is a little hard. There is a parking area and toilet about 100 meters from the trailhead and roadside parking is allowed on one side of the road (testing period of 3 months but not sure when it ends). Anyway, park a little bit further and walk to the trailhead entrance. After all, you’re going there to hike right?

Saw lots of selaginella intermedia (a type of fern). Both the green and bronze type. There are also lots of this very common fern that looks like a web of hexagons... I haven’t found out what it’s called.

It was a fun hike though we didn’t go far. Didn’t even get to the hanging bridge... that would be the goal for next trip 😊💪🏻"
"Beautiful trail with lots of flowers, monkey, bees and bubs. There are several small trails which you can chose to make your own journey. There are nice bridges with nice background for photography lovers. This is my second time here which remind me about the first one when I search for the sun. This is the place I got lots for so long. Lost my way to escape and lost in mind. Finally in this second time, it's also not possible to find out the sun.
Eccepting... all!"
Second visit to Bukit Gasing but still cant find the hanging bridge.
"Nice hike to work out   and sweat. Weekdays very quiet, few regular hikers."
One great experience for a new hiker for me. Good hill for training my endurance. Great trail too. Only part some places are not well kept. Dirty . Many adventure trails inside there. Lot of bushes . Be lert of snakes . Many there
"A perfect trail for everyone catering to all sorts of hiking difficulty. Situated in PJ, it’s accessible to most KL and PJ folks. Houses a couple of bridges and a wide variety of flora and fauna which you may have a chance to stumble upon completing your trail.

However parking is limited and chances are you’ll get your parking summons even on a Sunday should you park your car on the road instead of the designated parking area provided by the local council

A must try for everyone"
A hiking for beginners. Chill place.
"It's a basic hiking.. very nice place..
If you guys wanna try for a first time basic hiking..you guys should try here.. it's got few activities there.. I'm sure you guys will enjoy it.. nature love.. fresh air."
"If you love to hike with ease, here's the place for you. It's beginners friendly with a mild uphill challenge before the false peak.

Any other attractions? There's a bridge which is a must visit for every hikers, some friendly animals wandering about when you hike and always a number of hikers (safer).

Tips -
You'd better be there at 645am to secure a parking, or you have to battle your way to the entrance from you miles-away-parking. Enforcement team comes frequently to try to issue you ticket.

Bonus -
1. There are a few branches and you may come again and again to explore all possibilities.

2. Sometimes you will be greeted by the hill's ""residents"" - snakes, chickens, monkeys and sorts. Just chill, no report of any serious injuries. Sometime animals attack just to defend, so maybe you just give them a space to escape and they will gladly do so (human are still the deadlist species).

No admission fees required but please keep the trek clean and green.

Have fun hiking, stay healthy."
A nice quote undisturbed jungle trail that is for the more fit - lots of steep stairs to climb and it is a good couple of hours to walk around the smaller loop - longer for the larger trail. Lots to see - small steams and vantage points to see a view of the jungle. Quite busy at the weekend so be careful and bring your water - no stores here
"Get lost in the many trails that this little forest, until it lasts. They are chewing small bites of forest as the years pass but to build more and more fancy but empty condos. Get there early in the morning and explore this little city jungle, and if you have time I would totally recommend leaving from the PJ entrance and stopping by Raju for a Roti Canai."
Great place for a short and easy hiking. The suspension bridge is nothing to shout about. Don't expect to take a lot of photos at the bridge during public holidays as there will be many hikers there impatiently waiting for you to cross. Parking space is scarce as well during this time.
"Should you look for a nice, sportive and near KL hike.
This hike welcomes all levels and includes 3 peaks with great views. The access is quite easy and take approximately 30min by car/motorbike from City center (parking spots available in front of the entrance).
The hike is 1:30-2:00 long for 4.5km. Before walking in, Mae sure you have some water and mosquitoes repellent.
You can cross the path of monkeys, lizards, birds and all kind of insects.
Enjoy your hike!"
"One of the best trekking trails in Kuala Lumpur with in near radius of the city. If you are on a visit to Malaysia and you are a trekking enthusiast make sure to plan for a morning trek. I am sure you will have one of the best experiences ever. Such a beautiful greenery paradise you get to visit in the city of tall buildings.

I loved every step that I had in the hiking trial. There are various options available to you to either have a short, medium or a longer trail. If you are fit, plan to go for a long trial. It will be one memorable experience that you gift yourself with."
"One of the best place to begin hike and do activities with family, friends or alone. Can hear the chirping of birds and see the beauty of the plants when climbing. There is also a suspension bridge here. Not so quiet because many people are here, especially on weekends and during holidays."
Slowly but steady 😂.....it take 1 hour 40 minute for me to reach the peak due to not have a good stamina hahaha...the trail is easy but just to be careful for your step cause the stairs was to high to climb....there have different route to take and need to bring someone that experience in this area....btw is really quite challenging for me cause my weakness is climb the stairways 😂
Plenty of trails on silt grounds and very occasional phyllites. Good to start early as the crowds convene past 7am.
"It's a good hike even for beginners, the trails are well marked out. Do go to toilet beforehand near the entrance if there's a need. Or you can actually use the toilet on top of the hill. There are locks there but it's actually not locked.
There'll be crowds especially during the weekends. On top of the hill there's also a little Hindu temple. There are monkeys at the top of the hill but they are friendly ones."
Nice place to hike.
Right in the heart of KL an amazing natural jungle reserve that gives all the adventurous in you a great workout.  So many trails and great workout going up the hills!
"Tough walk uphill. Stick to Bukit Kiara park if you want an easy hike and free of mozzies. When it rains , the path can be slippery overnite , nx 2-3 days.

For people whom are regular hikes and uphill climbers.

Bring mozzies spray as I saw anopheles mosquitos buzzing. They are the mozzies with stripes"
"My fab place for a weekend sweatout. Been here since 2014 n still hv not fully explored these hills. To graduate, must do the ""Stairway to Heaven"". See you next weekend!"
Nice place to run from busy city
"Technically for 1st timer, I suggest that you come with a more experienced hiker who knows the way in Bukit Gasing. Been here twice with my 5yo son and both times we got lost 😂😂😂 but lucky us there were hikers who helped us find our way. In terms of the track, it's doable and I would say a family friendly track...there are a few routes which you can take but unfortunately not enough signboards to guide you..So all the best...if we can make it I'm sure you can too!!! 👍👍👍"
Hiking and sightseeing place. Can bring family here.Good for our health. It has hiking track for visitor and suitable for beginners. But too crowd during weekend. Some weekness is dont have enough parking space for visitor. Toilet available but not enought too. Hope that guardian of this recreation place built more toilet and rest area for visitors.
"After many years... Still love the hike. Went with colleagues. However, signboards can be helpful. I mean many signboards."
Overall quite an easy hike. The area is not very big. Its good for beginners.
"This hill is for easy goer. Its trail is easy and well maintain. We walk/hike for about 1 hour till the top, (menara). The hiking is about 1hour and half. Overall this place is enjoyable
Parking kinda tricky. As there is limited parking."
Great place to hiking. First time tried this place. First 10 minutes can run up but the at the peak you need to crawl if don't have stamina. Overall performance was great.  Managed to finish the hike in 19 minutes.
Bukit Gasing or Gasing Hill provides an excellent trail for trekkers who likes to keep fit. It also provides fresh air in the jungle surroundings. Always apply mosquito repellants to avoid bites. The hanging suspension bridge is most interesting.
"Nice hiking place. A lot of slopes... well maintained.
But beware of mosquitoes.."
love the trail & green trees. i do think management should update the park map and put more signage as i most new comers will get lost and keep going in circle.
Short trails suitable for beginners. Too many flies 😳
"One of the best place for beginners. you won't get lost. friendly people around will help you to get where you want to go. There are many entrance, you will enjoy if you go in a group"
"My weekend getaway.
If you adventurous, pack few snack bars & 2 bottle 500ml and get different tracks.
You may discover a lot of tracks between Bukit Gasing & Bukit Kerinchi.
Get lost and you may find a new experience.
You might learn to read your location from the Google Maps.
You may always can ask people pass you, they may can tell you back to starting point.
All the best!"
"i used to rate this place 5 stars but its gone downhill ever since. many who use the place have no qualms throwing rubbish on the ground. those in charge of maintenance have stupid ideas like a placing a huge metal sheet over a shallow stream. they also built steps on steep slopes which could never cope with nature and erosion, and now have become a hazard."
"Very good place to bring family and friends, it isn't that hard to hike to the top, very clean place, no dangerous or weird insects besides red ants, advised to start the hike at 7.30 am, mosquito repellent is not needed as long as you keep on moving, lack of parking"
"Lovely respite in middle of the city. The view isn't amazing, but there are many trails along the way. You can download the app Komoot and follow them, so you always know where you are.

Peacefulness - 5/10. Doesn't feel completely isolated and it's a pretty popular hiking spot. On plus side, you can always find someone to help out if you get lost.
Scenery - 5/10. Feels quite secondary forest-y, but still 90% shaded throughout so you can go at 1pm and it's still fine.
Trail exploration - 8/10, many options to zig zag around from west to east and north.
Challenge factor - 4/10 Trail starts off pretty steep with steps upwards, but the rest of it is fine with more declines than inclines."
"Good place, no entrance fee,  the MPPJ should preserve, upgrade and do some maintenance of this city forest. I recommend this for those who wants to go for hiking from easy to moderate level."
"Visited concrete bridge, suspension bridge, mountain top, took about 3 hours for up and down journey (we are beginners), moderate level or above"
"Good park for hiking, many trails but east to lost a way, sometimes not enough directions. This place like a forest or jungle, birds sound from everywhere"
"Forest in the city, easy to reach. Easy to healthy lifestyle. Multiple access from different access points.

Have few interesting points, 2 bridges, look out tower, camp site, water fall, river, indian temple, telco tower.

Good workout routine, good ascending gradient. Well explore and safety, good community."
The place so relaxing and its feels like my home..even thougth its in the middle of the city but still so quite and peaceful..you really can relax ur mind...the walk not so tiring and its so easy to go...but then mosquito keep disturbing me😢😢😢😢😢and the rest of our walk is really great.
A forest in the middle of the city. It's an all weather hikers paradise. It's cool in the trails even at noon. Of course you should avoid hiking in thunderstorm for good reason.
"Simple casual hike, suitable for beginners. Said to have more than 20 different trails, so know where you're going!"
Its good hiking trail for beginners like me🤗
"Education for younger generation on conservation of forest is vital. And this place provide that, if anyone does read this comment. Just enjoy the vibe and ask one question when you return back home ""why are we not giving the orang asli more financial support?"""
"Bukit Gasing is one of the best hill for casual to seasoned hikers if you lived in central KL or around Petaling Jaya area.

The only issue with the area is parking as it is located within a big housing area. It is recommended to park somewhere far and not obstructing other road users and slowly walk to the hill entrance.

I've use this hill as my training ground for hiking Gunung Rinjani in Lombok, Indonesia back in 2016.

Make sure to be nice and greet other hikers as it is slowly becoming a norm for many hikers to wear Bluetooth headset and zoned out instead of being aware of their surrounding..."
"I enjoyed the streams, as they were all clear water. I was able to see the saddle barbs and pearl danio with no problems"
Great Place Place for family hiking. Is very relax and easy
"During this pandemic, there are guard at the entrance to make sure people follow the right track and not crowded. But still the track still available and people still use to jog and exercise there. For camping site maybe not available due to pandemic.  There are many check point and tel line also available there. You can use Google maps to look at where direction you're ahead."
Great place to hike. No frills just follow path. Choose own desired difficulties
We choose the simplest route for the kids. We will come again for sure.
Great for exercising hiking! Many friendly people there. If you come alone just follow group of people for a guide.
Super place for a outing. Could be better is trails are marked and somebody can do online maps of those.
Nice place for hiking with family. Kids friendly.
Popular hiking trail suitable for beginners. Trails are mixture of uphills and downhills. Will be slippery after downpour. Time taken ranging from 1-2 hours depending on speed of hiking. Highlight is the suspension bridge & a steep hike to the peak.
"Fantastic place.. One of the trail feel like ""Batu Cave Stair"".."
Best for Kinabalu training...The trail is long 8km but quite confusing due it has a lot of trail/entrance/exit... Sometimes u enter from PJ then exit Hill Park 😆 Makes sure you know where you enter..
"Good thing about this place is near my house.  Just can walk within 10min.
Bad thing is trash everywhere.. to all visitor please keep this place clean as your home ok.."
"This place have lots of stairs, slippery after raining, alot of people but is safe because got alot of people and we'll maintained!"
"Went there.. About 500m walk and it started to rain ☔☔☔😫
First time.. Need to come back.. I heard people say that it's a great healing place..
Can't wait to go again tomorrow.."
Best place to warm up before for G7
"It's really a nice place for a hike or even a walk. A haven smack in the middle of Klang Valley. Only thing is, we need more signs for the various trails to help the many new hikers."
If you got kids this is the best place to bring them hiking around. Let them explore the forest world 👍👍👍
"Good hikes. Many fork road. Make a point to remember or use app /gps.
A lot of people during weekend. Parking is along the black line. Please don't double park or park at yellow line. That will make it difficult for other cars when 2 ways becomes 1 way.
Go to toilet before going in as there is no toilet inside the park. Public toilet at parking lot outside the park only opens from 8am. Go to toilet at restaurants on main road if you have to.
Bring water. Lots of shades n lots of stairs climb."
Trails are not exactly well marked but the routes are easy for people who hikes occasionally
Went last weekend with my family. Parking not easy to find. There is a parking space but limited. There is also a toilet at the parking space.
"It was a great hike. Mostly steps all the way, just a tad bit tiring but a good test on endurance. I went on Sunday morning so it was a little crowded but it wasn't too bad. If you're searching for a great view then you are probably going to be dissapointed but the hike itself is fulfilling."
"There is hardly any signs or path indicators when you get into the trail. So my friend and I just asked whoever we met at the crossroads as to which path leads to where. We got our way around though, but just bear that in mind."
"Nice hiking trail, Recommended!"
"It is good for those who wants to stretch your leg. Good environment. Lack of facility such as toilet at the front gate, but it is okay."
I'm in no way a frequent hiker but I really enjoyed myself there with my parents. We started our hike to the suspension bridge at around 7.15am and finished around 9.30am (including breaks). It can be a bit dark in the early hours and it …
Very good place for training hiking and train our statemina.  And have more road can hiking. Very fun. If have sign board and toilet is more better.
"Perfect for little hiking, avoid going during raining season"
"Reasonably easy hiking trail that is well marked, clear of rubbish n safe for senior citizens n family members. This is my first hike in Bkt Gasing n I completed the 4 km trail in 100 mins. Ideal for city dwellers as it took me only 20 minutes to drive from Mont Kiara to this place in the early morning."
Nice workout nature place on weekend. Suggest to setup more sign boards for reference. Glad to see volunteers keeping environment clean and tidy. Thank you guys! Had sweaty fun with friends.
"Limited parking lot with toilet, the trail is not difficult...
Some tree block the road today..."
Well preserved place. Beautiful flora and fauna. Clean and peaceful
Favourite short hike during the weekend. Level is at begknner. View on top at the Indian temple and suspension bridge on the other side is not bad too.
"Is a good place to hike especially for beginners. Nothing too hard, just plentiful of stairs which can make you tired fast. Make sure to prepare plenty of water and energy bars if required."
